Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling SB Bank. My name is John. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi John. My name is Sarah. I'm looking to get a new credit card and was hoping to understand my options with SB Bank.

Agent: Great, Sarah. We have several excellent credit card offers available. What are you looking for in a new card? 

Customer: Well, I'd like a card with no annual fee, good rewards on groceries and gas, and a 0% intro APR offer would be nice too. 

Agent: Okay, let me take a look at what we have available that meets those needs. We have 5 cards I'd recommend taking a look at. The SB Rewards Card has no annual fee, 2x points on groceries and gas and 0% APR for the first 12 months. The SB Premier Card also has no annual fee, 3x points on groceries and gas, and 0% APR for 15 months. 

Customer: Those both sound pretty good so far. What other options are there?

Agent: We also have the SB Mileage Card with no annual fee, 2x miles on all purchases, and 0% APR for 12 months. The SB Cashback Card has no annual fee, 2% cashback on groceries and gas, and 0% APR for 6 months. And finally, the SB Platinum Card has a $95 annual fee but has the best rewards - 5x points on groceries and gas and 0% APR for 18 months.

Customer: I see. Of those options, I think the SB Premier Card sounds the best for my needs. The extra 3x points on groceries and gas would really add up for me. And 15 months of 0% APR is great too. 

Agent: Excellent choice! The SB Premier Card is one of our most popular cards. Would you like me to go ahead and submit an application for you today?

Customer: Hi John, my name is Sarah. I'm calling because I noticed you guys charged me an international transaction fee on my credit card statement this month, even though my account terms say it's supposed to be zero for international purchases. 

Agent: I apologize for the confusion Sarah. Let me take a look at your account to see what's going on with that international transaction fee. May I get your full name and account number to pull up your statement?

Customer: Sure, my name is Sarah Thompson and my account number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234.

Agent: Thanks for providing that. I'm looking at your statement now and you're correct - there is a $5 international transaction fee listed from your purchase at a retailer in France last week.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate you looking into that and issuing the refund. Do you know why it was charged in the first place if it should be 0%?

Agent: Good question. It looks like when this charge was processed, there was a temporary system issue that caused some international transactions to incorrectly incur the standard 3% foreign transaction fee.
