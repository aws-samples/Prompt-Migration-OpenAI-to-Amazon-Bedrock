Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\n [source page: 46] Cash Flows from Operating Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years Ended December 31 (Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,Net income including noncontrolling interest,""$ 5,363"",""$ 4,869"",""$ 5,058""\n2,Depreciation and amortization,""1,488"",""1,544"",""1,474""\n3,Company pension and postretirement contributions,(370),(967),(383)\n4,Company pension and postretirement expense,410,334,250\n5,Stock-based compensation expense,302,324,298\n6,Gain on sale of businesses,(545),(586),(111)\n7,Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes),77,""1,074"",108\n8,Accounts receivable,(305),(245),(313)\n9,Inventories,(509),(387),57\n10,Accounts payable,408,24,148\n11,Other - net,120,256,76\n12,Net cash provided by operating activities,""$ 6,439"",""$ 6,240"",""$ 6,662""\n }\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\nIn 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years ended December 31 (Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,""Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)"",""$ (1,577)"",""$ (1,373)"",""$ (1,420)""\n2,Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets,262,49,58\n3,""Acquisitions, net of cash acquired"",13,""(2,023)"",(16)\n4,""Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net"",669,(798),(163)\n5,""Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold"",846,""1,065"",142\n6,Other - net,9,(6),(4)\n7,Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,$ 222,""$ (3,086)"",""$ (1,403)""\n }\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 primarily relate to the sale of 3M\'s Communication Markets Division and the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring within the Safety and Graphics business segment.\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M\'s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 44] Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\nAt December 31, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $3.975 billion and $180 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 11.\n [source page: 44] Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,December,""31,"",2018 versus\n1,(Millions),2018,2017,2017\n2,Total debt,""$ 14,622"",""$ 13,949"",$ 673\n3,""Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities"",""3,270"",""4,156"",(886)\n4,Net debt (non-GAAP measure),""$ 11,352"",""$ 9,793"",""$ 1,559""\n }\n\nRefer to the preceding ""Total Debt"" and ""Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities"" sections for additional details.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 49] Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\'s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.\nIn 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points. Refer to the preceding ""Cash Flows from Operating Activities"" section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow.

A company\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 7, 2019\nWe have served as the Company\'s auditor since 1975.\n\n\n\n3M Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statement of Incom e Years ended December 31\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""(Millions, except per share amounts)"",2018,2017,2016\n1,Net sales,""$ 32,765"",""$ 31,657"",""$ 30,109""\n2,Operating expenses,,,\n3,Cost of sales,""16,682"",""16,055"",""15,118""\n4,""Selling, general and administrative expenses"",""7,602"",""6,626"",""6,311""\n5,""Research, development and related expenses"",""1,821"",""1,870"",""1,764""\n6,Gain on sale of businesses,(547),(586),(111)\n7,Total operating expenses,""25,558"",""23,965"",""23,082""\n8,Operating income,""7,207"",""7,692"",""7,027""\n9,,,,\n10,""Other expense (income), net"",207,144,(26)\n11,,,,\n12,Income before income taxes,""7,000"",""7,548"",""7,053""\n13,Provision for income taxes,""1,637"",""2,679"",""1,995""\n14,Net income including noncontrolling interest,""$ 5,363"",""$ 4,869"",""$ 5,058""\n15,,,,\n16,Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest,14,11,8\n17,,,,\n18,Net income attributable to 3M,""$ 5,349"",""$ 4,858"",""$ 5,050""\n19,,,,\n20,Weighted average 3M common shares outstanding -

In addition, in October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included within interest expense. Capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\nInterest income increased year-on-year in both 2018 and 2017 due to higher average interest rates.\nEffective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with 3M's adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, all pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost components (except the service cost component) are reported within other expense (income), net. For additional details, refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies). Year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service costs increased $55 million and $68 million for the year 2018 and 2017, respectively. The year-on-year increases were primarily due to an increase in the net actuarial amortization expense.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Total Debt:\nThe strength of 3M\'s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\'s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\'s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service.\nThe Company\'s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\' discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 47] Cash Flows from Financing Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years ended December 31 (Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,Change in short-term debt - net,$ (284),$ 578,$ (797)\n2,Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days),""(1,034)"",(962),(992)\n3,Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days),""2,251"",""1,987"",""2,832""\n4,Total cash change in debt,$ 933,""$ 1,603"",""$ 1,043""\n5,Purchases of treasury stock,""(4,870)"",""(2,068)"",""(3,753)""\n6,Proceeds from issuances of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and benefit plans,485,734,804\n7,Dividends paid to stockholders,""(3,193)"",""(2,803)"",""(2,678)""\n8,Other net,(56),(121),(42)\n9,Net cash used in financing activities,""$ (6,701)"",""$ (2,655)"",""$ (4,626)""\n }\n\n2018 Debt Activity:\nTotal debt was approximately $14.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to the third quarter 2018 issuance of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes, which was partially offset by the $450 million third quarter repayment and 500 million Euro fourth quarter repayment of maturing medium-term notes, the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects, and lower year on year commercial paper balance. Outstanding commercial paper was $435 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $745 million at December 31, 2017. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in ""Change in short-term debt - net"" in the preceding table. 3M\'s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances.\nProceeds from debt for 2018 primarily relate to the September 2018, issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 3.00%, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a coupon rate of 3.25%, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2028 with a coupon rate of 3.625%, and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. Refer to Note 12 for more detail of these debt issuances.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\'s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in ""Change in short-term debt - net"" in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.\nProceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to Note 12 for more detail of these debt issuances.\nIn October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $125 million compared with December 31, 2017. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $568 million, driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $443 million, primarily due to decreases in short-term debt.\nAccounts receivable increased $109 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased sales. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 accounts receivable by $166 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased accounts receivable by $29 million. Inventory increased $332 million from December 31, 2017, impacted by maintenance of additional inventory during\n\n\n\nthe deployment in the U.S. of the Company\'s ERP system.

Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of legal fees and other related\n\n\n\nobligations, was reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, 3M\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased year-on-year.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $74 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company\'s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual.

Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award\'s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.\nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available- for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\'s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\'s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n\n\n\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\'s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 05,Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\nLeases: 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M\'s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M\'s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up tofive years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\nRelated Party Activity:\nOther than the amounts due by and between the Aearo Entities and related entities (as described in Note 16), 3M does not have any material related party activity.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 21] Foreign exchange impacts:\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income by approximately $271 million and $103 million (or a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $280 million and $119 million) year-on-year for 2022 and 2021, respectively. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nOther expense (income), net:\nLower income related to higher non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense increased expense year-on-year for 2022. Higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-on-year for 2021. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same period year-on-year due in part to interest expense savings from early debt extinguishment actions in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax rate:\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the Food Safety business (see Note 3). The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 17.7 percent, 18.1 percent, and 20.5 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 0.4 percent percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 2.4 percentage points from 2020 to 2021.\n\n\nShares of common stock outstanding:\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share per diluted share for 2022, while higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share diluted share for 2021.\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Operating income, segment operating income (loss), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. While the Company includes certain items in its measure of segment operating performance, it also considers these non- GAAP measures in evaluating and managing its operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is useful to investors in understanding underlying business performance, while also providing additional transparency to the special items. Special items impacting operating income are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed the extent of matters and charges/benefits it includes within special items with respect to net costs for significant litigation. Previously, 3M included net costs, when significant, associated with changes in accrued liabilities related to respirator mask/asbestos litigation and PFAS-related other environmental matters, along with the associated tax impacts. These non-GAAP measure changes involved including net costs for litigation related to 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs, expanding net costs to include external legal fees and insurance recoveries associated with the applicable matters in addition to changes in accrued liabilities, and to include all such net costs for the applicable matters, not just when considered significant. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nSpecial items for the periods presented include:\nNet costs for significant litigation:\nThese relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 16). Net costs include the impacts of any changes in accrued liabilities, external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with associated tax impacts. Prior to initiating voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters along with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. During the bankruptcy period, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continue to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Net costs associated with PFAS-related other environmental matters are primarily reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated.\nDivestiture costs:\nThese include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 19] OVERVIEW\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made the following changes:\nChanges in measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M\'s disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Changes to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to theCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.\n\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this document. Given the diversity of 3M\'s businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Item 7. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M\'s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2022, 3M\'s costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measuressection below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). These matters are further discussed in Note 16. In 2022, 3M also completed the split-off of its Food Safety Division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in Note 15. SeeCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items.\n\n\n\n3M Belgium has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, as more fully discussed in Note16. As discussed in Note 16, 3M Belgium received agreement with authorities in June 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium has provided information required by the Flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done SO for production or sampling purposes. Belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. See further discussion in Note 16.\n3M is also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In light of a number of factors, 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022, the net sales of which were less than one percent of 3M\'s consolidated net sales for 2021. Further, in September 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. The associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in Note 15. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in Russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. Further supply disruption could lead to downstream customer impacts.\nThough 3M monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3M\'s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Relevant risk factors can be found in Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating income margin and earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted:\nThe following table provides the increases (decreases) in operating income margins and diluted earnings per share.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,,Year ended,""December 31,"",\n1,,2022,,2021,\n2,,Percent of net sales,Earnings per diluted share,Percent of net sales,Earnings per diluted share\n3,Same period last year,20.8 %,$ 10.12,22.3 %,$ 9.36\n4,Net costs for significant litigation,1.4,0.61,1.0,0.37\n5,Gain on business divestitures,-,-,(1.2),(0.52)\n6,Divestiture-related restructuring actions,-,-,0.2,0.08\n7,Total special items,1.4,0.61,-,(0.07)\n8,""Same period last year, excluding special items"",22.2,10.73,22.3,9.29\n9,Increase/(decrease) due to:,,,,\n10,Total organic growth/productivity and other,1.0,0.56,0.7,1.07\n11,Raw material impact,(2.4),(1.13),(0.8),(0.27)\n12,Divestitures,-,(0.05),-,(0.05)\n13,Foreign exchange impacts,-,(0.39),-,0.16\n14,""Other expense (income), net"",N/A,0.02,N/A,0.27\n15,Income tax rate,N/A,0.06,N/A,0.32\n16,Shares of common stock outstanding,N/A,0.30,N/A,(0.06)\n17,""Current period, excluding special items"",20.8,10.10,22.2,10.73\n18,Net costs for significant litigation,(6.7),(3.20),(1.4),(0.61)\n19,Divestiture costs,(0.2),(0.08),-,-\n20,Gain on business divestitures,8.0,4.73,-,-\n21,Divestiture-related restructuring actions,(0.1),(0.05),-,-\n22,Russia exit charges,(0.3),(0.20),-,-\n23,PFAS manufacturing exit costs,(2.4),(1.12),-,-\n24,Total special items,(1.7),0.08,(1.4),(0.61)\n25,Current period,19.1%,$ 10.18,20.8 %,$ 10.12\n }\n\nThe Company refers to various ""adjusted"" amounts or measures on an ""adjusted basis"".

In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022 was $800 million. Additional details about 3M's long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company's long-term debt.\nCommodity Prices Risk:\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\n\n\n\nValue At Risk:\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company's sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at December 31, 2022. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Adverse impact on,after-tax earnings,Positive impact on,after-tax earnings\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2022,2021\n2,Foreign exchange rates,$ (315),$ (140),$ 314,$ 147\n3,Interest rates,(18),(2),18,2\n4,Commodity prices,(5),(21),7,14\n }\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $85 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $45 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n"", ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 35] Assessments of Goodwill:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $12.8 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\n\n\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2022 completed as of October 1, 2022, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2022, 3M had 21 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\nFollowing the annual impairment test, as a result of 3M's December 2022 announced commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Notes 4 and 15, 3M tested the Advanced Materials and Electronics Materials Solutions reporting units (within the Transportation and Electronics business) for impairment resulting in a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit.\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2023 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 63] Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets, in addition to the balance of non-amortizable intangible assets follow:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,December,""31,""\n1,(Millions),2022,2021\n2,Customer related intangible assets,""$ 4,062"",""$ 4,216""\n3,Patents,426,513\n4,Other technology-based intangible assets,""2,081"",""2,111""\n5,Definite-lived tradenames,""1,166"",""1,171""\n6,Other amortizable intangible assets,84,105\n7,Total gross carrying amount,""7,819"",""8,116""\n8,,,\n9,Accumulated amortization - customer related,""(1,747)"",""(1,616)""\n10,Accumulated amortization - patents,(421),(500)\n11,Accumulated amortization - other technology-based,""(1,000)"",(839)\n12,Accumulated amortization - definite-lived tradenames,(509),(447)\n13,Accumulated amortization - other,(60),(79)\n14,Total accumulated amortization,""(3,737)"",""(3,481)""\n15,,,\n16,Total finite-lived intangible assets - net,""4,082"",""4,635""\n17,,,\n18,Non-amortizable intangible assets (primarily tradenames),617,653\n19,Total intangible assets - net,""$ 4,699"",""$ 5,288""\n }\n\n\n\n\nCertain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 60 years, have a history of leading-market share positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an indefinite period of time.\nAs discussed in Note 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M\'s commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to impairment of long-lived assets and an immaterial charge related to impairment of indefinite-lived assets.\nAmortization expense follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nExpected amortization expense for acquired amortizable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate.

This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $6.00 per share and marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 44] Balance Sheet:\n3M\'s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.\nWorking Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,December,""31,"",2018 versus\n1,(Millions),2018,2017,2017\n2,Current assets,""$ 13,709"",""$ 14,277"",$ (568)\n3,Less: Current liabilities,""7,244"",""7,687"",(443)\n4,Working capital (non-GAAP measure),""$ 6,465"",""$ 6,590"",$ (125)\n }\n\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $125 million compared with December 31, 2017. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $568 million, driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $443 million, primarily due to decreases in short-term debt.\nAccounts receivable increased $109 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased sales. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 accounts receivable by $166 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased accounts receivable by $29 million. Inventory increased $332 million from December 31, 2017, impacted by maintenance of additional inventory during\n\n\n\nthe deployment in the U.S. of the Company\'s ERP system. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 inventory by $154 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased inventory by $23 million.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 27] 2019 closed acquisitions:\nIn February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal for cash of approximately $0.7 billion, subject to closing and other adjustments, and assumption of approximately $0.3 billion of M*Modal\'s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare technology provider of cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient narrative.

A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $21 million in 2018, compared to an increase of $16 million in 2017. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 65] Earnings Per Share Computations\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts)"",2018,2017,2016\n1,Numerator:,,,\n2,Net income attributable to 3M,""$ 5,349"",""$ 4,858"",""$ 5,050""\n3,,,,\n4,Denominator:,,,\n5,Denominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding basic,588.5,597.5,604.7\n6,Dilution associated with the Company\'s stock-based compensation plans,13.5,15.2,14.0\n7,Denominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding-dilute,602.0,612.7,618.7\n8,,,,\n9,Earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders- basic,$ 9.09,$ 8.13,$ 8.35\n10,Earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders-diluted,$ 8.89,$ 7.93,$ 8.16\n }\n\nStock-based compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees\' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect\n\n\n\nto income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award\'s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.\nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.\nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\'s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\'s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\'s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, ,Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 46] Cash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow.

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years ended December 31 (Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,""Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)"",""$ (1,577)"",""$ (1,373)"",""$ (1,420)""\n2,Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets,262,49,58\n3,""Acquisitions, net of cash acquired"",13,""(2,023)"",(16)\n4,""Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net"",669,(798),(163)\n5,""Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold"",846,""1,065"",142\n6,Other - net,9,(6),(4)\n7,Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,$ 222,""$ (3,086)"",""$ (1,403)""\n }\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 primarily relate to the sale of 3M\'s Communication Markets Division and the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring within the Safety and Graphics business segment.\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M\'s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 41] Asset Impairments:\nAs of December 31, 2018, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.7 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 3M\'s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\nAs of October 1, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more. 3M\'s market value at both December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\' equity of approximately $10 billion.\nAs discussed in Note 3, 3M sold its Communication Markets division in 2018, which comprised substantially all of the $272 million reduction in goodwill associated with divestitures during 2018.\nIn 2018, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were\n\n\n\nweighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\'s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\'s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\'s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\'s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Total Debt:\nThe strength of 3M\'s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\'s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\'s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service.\nThe Company\'s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\' discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 39] CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.

These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\nDigital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022 from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 15% year-over-year growth.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 37] Digital Media\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and\n\n\n [source page: 38] Table of Contents\nsyncing of files across users\' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (""ETLAs""), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (""DDOM"") and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Creative ARR,Annual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value\n1,Document Cloud ARR,Annual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services + Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\n2,Digital Media ARR,Creative ARR + Document Cloud ARR\n }\n\nIn March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reported above.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 64] Adopted Accounting Guidance and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nThere have been no recent accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting pronouncements or recently adopted accounting guidance during fiscal 2022 that are of significance or potential significance to us.\n [source page: 64] NOTE 2.

In a creator economy that is continually expanding, creators are looking for tools to help them easily make and share unique and beautiful content with speed and ease. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team sport that is redefining productivity, making collaboration even more critical to every company\'s success. We believe Adobe is in a strong position to address these trends with innovation that will democratize creativity, empowering individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enabling more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.\nThe flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription service that allows members to use our creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices.

We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.\nWe market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS"") model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud- based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (""VARs""), systems integrators (""SIs""), independent software vendors (""ISVs""), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs""). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (""EMEA""); and Asia-Pacific (""APAC"").\nAdobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from our website free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable content, particularly misleading content intended to manipulate public opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better serve our customers and expand our customer base. Our brands may be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate newsworthy content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion (e.g., ""DeepFakes""), by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our products and services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, illegal content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation designed to address DeepFakes could adversely impact our product offerings.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 67] Refund Liabilities\nWe record refund liabilities for amounts that may be subject to future refunds, which include sales returns reserves and customer rebates and credits.

Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma\'s Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing.

Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and\n\n\n [source page: 38] Table of Contents\nsyncing of files across users\' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (""ETLAs""), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (""DDOM"") and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes.

As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reported above.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 39] Table of Contents\nOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth.

By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers.

Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non- refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.\n\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 41] Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generallyacceptedaccountingprinciples(GAAP).Therefore,theyshould not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.

The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, partially offset by an $87 million ARR reduction taken in March 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. Creative revenue of $10.46 billion increased by $913 million, or 10%, during fiscal 2022, from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021. Document Cloud revenue of $2.38 billion increased by $409 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2022, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021.

Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\'s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.\nIn 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points.

58","56,60","The Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) for the fiscal year 2015 was $94 million as per the provided context. To calculate the D&A percentage margin, we need to divide D&A by net revenue and multiply by 100. The net revenue for 2015 was $3,991 million.So, the calculation would be: ($94/$3,991)*100 = 2.36%Therefore, the Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) percentage margin for AMD in 2015 was approximately 2.36%.","['<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Gross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 27% in 2015 compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and also by lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 39] Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to 2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the\n\n\nuncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to approximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. The remaining two reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2013, each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nEstimates of fair value for all or our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result.

Asset balances reclassified into other current assets included goodwill of $42 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, the Company\'s realignment of its organizational structure, effective July 1, 2014, caused a change in the composition of the Company\'s reportable segments and reporting units. This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Company\'s reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during the third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Company\'s estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the Company\'s reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting unit\'s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill. In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the reporting units to its carrying value. The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair value, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step of the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any unrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the present value of future cash flows based on management\'s forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment exceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in ""Goodwill impairment charge"" on the Company\'s consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to these reporting units. In connection with completing the goodwill\n\n\nimpairment analysis, the Company reviewed its long-lived tangible and intangible assets within the Computing and Graphics reporting unit under ASC 360, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."" The Company determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess of their carrying values, and therefore these assets were not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill. Based on the results of the Company\'s analysis of goodwill, each reporting unit\'s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment in 2015 and 2013.\nAcquisition-related intangible assets\nAs a part of the Company\'s strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company decided to exit the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in ""Restructuring and other special charges, net"" on the Company\'s consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property.\nThe balances of acquisition-related intangible assets as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n0,,,,""December 26, 2015"",,,,""December 27, 2014"",\n1,,Gross,Impairment charges,Accumulated Amortization,Net,Weighted-average amortization period,Gross,Accumulated Amortization,Net\n2,,,,,""(In millions,"",except years),,,\n3,Developed technology,$ 258,$ (54),$ (204),$ -,5.15 years,$ 258,$ (201),$ 57\n4,In-process research and development,6,(6),-,-,N/A,6,-,6\n5,Customer relationships,168,(1),(167),-,1.25 years,168,(167),1\n6,Trademark and trade name,37,(1),(36),-,1.25 years,37,(36),1\n7,Total,$ 469,$ (62),$ (407),$ -,4.56 years,$ 469,$ (404),$ 65\n }\n\nThe following table summarizes amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2015,2014,2013\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Developed technology,$ 3,$ 13,$ 13\n3,Customer relationships,-,1,1\n4,Trademark and trade name,-,-,4\n5,Total,$ 3,$ 14,$ 18\n }\n\nNOTE 7: Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 are summarized below:\n\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,Total Fair Value,Cash and Cash Equivalents\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,""December 26, 2015"",,\n3,Cash,$ 409,$ 409\n4,Level 2(2),,\n5,Commercial paper,376,376\n6,Total level 2,376,376\n7,Total,$ 785,$ 785\n }\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,Total Fair Value,Cash and Cash Equivalents,Short-Term Marketable Securities\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,""December 27, 2014"",,,\n3,Cash,$ 391,$ 391,$ -\n4,Level 1(1)(2),,,\n5,Money market funds,4,4,-\n6,Total level 1,4,4,-\n7,Level 2²(3),,,\n8,Commercial paper,618,410,208\n9,Corporate bonds,27,-,27\n10,Total level 2,645,410,235\n11,Total,""$ 1,040"",$ 805,$ 235\n }\n\n(1) The Company\'s Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in China. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.\n [source page: 47] FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 26, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $785 million were lower compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and the timing of related collections and the timing of accounts payable payments made. During 2015, we used $96 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 26, 2015 and 89% as of December 27, 2014.\n\n\nOur debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $2.3 billion as compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014. During 2015, we received $100 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with the savings from our restructuring plans and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.\nOver the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 94] Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

If such earnings were distributed, the Company would incur additional income taxes of approximately $107 million (after an adjustment for foreign tax credits). These additional income taxes may not result in income tax expense or a cash payment to the Internal Revenue Service, but may result in the utilization of deferred tax assets that are currently subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe Company partially recognized undistributed earnings within certain subsidiaries in China of $56 million through December 26, 2015 because the announcement in October 2015 of an agreement to sell 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou causes the Company to modify its judgment that associated undistributed earnings of that subsidiary\'s holding company in China will remain indefinitely reinvested. A future distribution of these earnings will give rise to an associated future withholding tax of $6 million. This is recognized as an income tax expense within the 2015 income tax provision. The same event results in the Chinese holding company recognizing the future benefit of tax losses available to offset taxable gains when the deal closes. The future benefit of those losses is $7 million and is a reduction in the 2015 income tax provision. The net effect of this event in the 2015 income tax provision is a reduction of $1 million.\nThe Company\'s operations in Malaysia currently operate under a tax holiday, which will expire in 2018. This tax holiday may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of the tax holiday did not decrease the Company\'s net loss in 2015 because the Company\'s operations in Malaysia operated at a net loss. The net impact of tax holidays decreased the Company\'s net loss by $2 million in 2014, less than $.01 per share, diluted, and decreased the Company\'s net loss by $1 million in 2013, less than $.01 per share, diluted.\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2015,2014,2013\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,$ 28,$ 52,$ 56\n3,Increases for tax positions taken in prior years,11,1,1\n4,Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years,(1),-,(2)\n5,Increases for tax positions taken in the current year,2,2,4\n6,Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities,(2),(27),(7)\n7,Balance at end of year,$ 38,$ 28,$ 52\n }\n\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $4 million, $3 million and $3 million as of December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively. The Company had no or immaterial amounts of accrued interest and no accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013. The Company recognizes the accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nDuring the 12 months beginning December 27, 2015, the Company does not expect to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolutions and/or closure of open audits are highly uncertain.\nAs of December 27, 2014, the Canada Revenue Agency, or CRA, had completed its audit of ATI for the years 2005 through 2010 and issued its final Notice of Assessment, which the Company has reviewed and agreed to. As of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of the Company\'s subsidiaries\' activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. The Company has agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties and $2 million in interest. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign, foreign provincial, and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has\n\n\nprovided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company has not recognized any current or long-term deferred tax assets under a valuation allowance as a result of the application of uncertainty in income taxes in ASC 740 for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 68] NOTE 5: Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\nInventories\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Raw materials,$ 16,$ 40\n3,Work in process,482,431\n4,Finished goods,180,214\n5,""Total inventories, net"",$ 678,$ 685\n }\n\nOther current assets\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Assets held-for-sale,$ 183,$ -\n3,Other current assets,65,48\n4,Total other current assets,$ 248,$ 48\n }\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Land and land improvements,$ 1,$ 4\n3,Buildings and leasehold improvements,145,246\n4,Equipment,821,""1,416""\n5,Construction in progress,17,14\n6,""Property, plant and equipment, gross"",984,""1,680""\n7,Accumulated depreciation and amortization,(796),""(1,378)""\n8,""Total property, plant and equipment, net"",$ 188,$ 302\n }\n\nDepreciation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $94 million, $115 million and $139 million, respectively.\nOther assets\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Software and technology licenses,$ 189,$ 219\n3,Other,134,125\n4,Total other assets,$ 323,$ 344\n }\n\nAccrued liabilities\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Accrued compensation and benefits,$ 95,$ 139\n3,Marketing programs and advertising expenses,109,141\n4,Software technology and licenses payable,50,39\n5,Other accrued and current liabilities,218,199\n6,Total accrued liabilities,$ 472,$ 518\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Liabilities related to assets held-for-sale,$ 79,$ -\n3,Other current liabilities,45,40\n4,Total other current liabilities,$ 124,$ 40\n }\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 40] Results of Operations\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer's prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming and Embedded.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n\n\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates (including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and inflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units' goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more- likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.\n\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 28] Operating Income Margin:\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools.

Management evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional (""dual"") credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (""sales district"") with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, a sales district within the Industrial business segment provides the contact for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled ""Elimination of Dual Credit,"" such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 67] Revenue\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) include amounts received from customers and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods for development services, IP licensing and product revenue.

These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management\'s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company\'s disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company\'s CODM assesses the company\'s financial performance and allocates resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.\nThe Company\'s four reportable segments are:\nthe Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers; the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers; the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments.

Revenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of products and services, both as a principal and as an agent. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of, the remaining benefits from the goods or\n\n\n\nservices. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. We generate all of our operating revenue from contracts with customers. Our revenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected.\nRevenue from product sales and services is reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and contract cancellations primarily based on historical refund rates, with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. There is inherent judgment in estimating future refunds as they are susceptible to factors outside of our influence. However, we have significant experience in estimating the amount of refunds, based primarily on historical data. Our refund liability for sales returns was $77 million and $23 million at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively, which is included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and represents the expected value of the aggregate refunds that will be due to our customers. We also have a corresponding asset included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that represents the inventory we expect to be returned, valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. As of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, this amount was $55 million and $0 million , respectively. The increases in our refund liability and corresponding asset balances from February 3, 2018, to February 2, 2019, are primarily driven by the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition guidance in the current year.\nFor revenue transactions that involve more than one performance obligation, we defer the revenue associated with any unsatisfied performance obligation until the obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed. For such contracts, we allocate revenue and any discounts to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or, when directly observable selling prices are not available, we generally use an expected cost-plus margin approach. Short-term deferred revenue was $446 million and $453 million as of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018 respectively. At February 2, 2019 , and February 3, 2018, deferred revenue included within long-term liabilities was $11 million and $22 million respectively.\nOur contract liabilities primarily relate to product merchandise not yet delivered to customers; unredeemed gift cards; services not yet completed; services technical support contracts, where performance is satisfied over the duration of the contract; and options that provide a material right to customers, such as our customer loyalty programs. Most of our contract liabilities have a duration of one year or less. For an insignificant portion of our technical support service contracts, terms of up to three years apply. We do not have any material contract assets.\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from our contracts with customers, which reflects the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of February 2, 2019 and February 4, 2018 ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""February 2, 2019"",""February 4, 2018""\n1,""Receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $13 and $24, respectively"",$ 565,$ 674\n2,Short-term contract liabilities included in:,,\n3,Unredeemed gift cards,290,316\n4,Deferred revenue,446,408\n5,Accrued liabilities,146,151\n6,Long-term contract liabilities included in:,,\n7,Long-term liabilities,11,22\n }\n\nWe establish allowances for uncollectible receivables based on historical collection trends and write-off history.

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in ""Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\n [source page: 43] Overview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry\'s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.\n\n\n\nWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm VersalTM ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership AI inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct™ ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm TM 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.\nIn the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen TM Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, loT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria TM KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision and industrial communication and control.\nFor the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new ""Zen 4"" architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with up to 16 ""Zen 4"" architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on ""Zen 3+"" architecture and includes AMD RDNATM 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing ""Zen 3"" architecture to premium Chrome os devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper TM PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on ""Zen 3"" core architecture.\nIn the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNATM 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.\nAlthough the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 48] Data Center\nData Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors.\nData Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under ""Expenses"" below.\n [source page: 48] Client\nClient net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit shipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.\nClient operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under ""Expenses"" below.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 50] Income Tax Provision (Benefit)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n [source page: 50] International Sales\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one year was $247 million, of which $213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less.\nRevenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 18% of the Company\'s revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n [source page: 67] NOTE 4 - Segment Reporting\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management\'s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company\'s disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company\'s CODM assesses the company\'s financial performance and allocates resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.\nThe Company\'s four reportable segments are:\nthe Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers; the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers; the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain.\n\n\n\nThe following table

These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, we review each potential customer's credit application and evaluate the applicant's financial history and ability and willingness to repay. We also consider credit performance by customer tenure, industry and geographic location in managing credit exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $350 billion and $327 billion, respectively of unused credit, primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements, of which approximately 80 percent was related to customers within the United States in both periods. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate - This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under ""Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity"" for further related definitions under Basel III.\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member\'s payment due date.\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out- of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member\'s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 49] INCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6 percent and 24.6 percent for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factor that decreased the effective tax rate for 2022 was the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on the split-off of the Food Safety business. The primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2021 in comparison to 2020 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) involved a transition tax that is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $380 million and $508 million, respectively, in long term income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $126 million and $68 million, respectively, payable within one year associated with the transition tax.\nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns through 2018, but the years 2005 through 2017 have not closed as the Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions where the Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments, which could be impacted by evolving political environments in those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company's tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M's unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.

These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer\'s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, we must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on management\'s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management\'s best judgment of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.

The prior years\' tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $402 million as of December 2, 2022, primarily related to certain state credits.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 45] BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic. Spending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis¹ Billed business, which represented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed business grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise customers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent year-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending momentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the large pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our international billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased 36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a modest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased versus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in 2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\n1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy.\nDuring the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.\nOur performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and our strategy, and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on delivering sustainable and profitable growth.\nSee ""Supervision and Regulation"" in ""Business"" for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for information on potential impacts of economic, geopolitical and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 102] Discount Revenue\nDiscount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid- sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our network partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 54] PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nCard Member loans and receivables provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to reserve builds in the current year, versus reserve releases in the prior year.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate - This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under ""Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity"" for further related definitions under Basel III.\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member\'s payment due date.\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out- of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member\'s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 157] PARENT COMPANY - CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years Ended December 31 (Millions),2022,2021,2020\n1,Cash Flows from Operating Activities,,,\n2,Net income,""$ 7,514"",""$ 8,060"",""$ 3,135""\n3,Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities:,,,\n4,Equity in net income of subsidiaries and affiliates,""(7,905)"",""(8,560)"",""(3,716)""\n5,Dividends received from subsidiaries and affiliates,""5,549"",""9,102"",""2,679""\n6,""Other operating activities, primarily with subsidiaries and affiliates"",160,(305),732\n7,Net cash provided by operating activities,""5,318"",""8,297"",""2,830""\n8,Cash Flows from Investing Activities,,,\n9,(Increase) decrease in loans to subsidiaries and affiliates,""(4,850)"",(176),""11,434""\n10,Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates,(1),(60),(52)\n11,Other investing activities,-,-,74\n12,Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities,""(4,851)"",(236),""11,456""\n13,Cash Flows from Financing Activities,,,\n14,Net decrease in short-term debt from subsidiaries and affiliates,(136),""(2,636)"",""(3,289)""\n15,Proceeds from long-term debt,""13,202"",""3,000"",-\n16,Payments of long-term debt,""(5,675)"",""(5,000)"",""(2,000)""\n17,Issuance of American Express preferred shares,-,""1,584"",-\n18,Redemption of American Express preferred shares,-,""(1,600)"",-\n19,Issuance of American Express common shares,56,64,44\n20,Repurchase of American Express common shares and other,""(3,502)"",""(7,652)"",""(1,029)""\n21,Dividends paid,""(1,565)"",""(1,448)"",""(1,474)""\n22,Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities,""2,380"",""(13,688)"",""(7,748)""\n23,Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents,""2,847"",""(5,627)"",""6,538""\n24,Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year,""5,341"",""10,968"",""4,430""\n25,Cash and cash equivalents at end of year,""$ 8,188"",""$ 5,341"",""$ 10,968""\n26,Supplemental cash flow information,,,\n27,Years Ended December 31 (Millions),2022,2021,2020\n28,Non-Cash Investing Activities,,,\n29,Loans to subsidiaries and affiliates,$ -,""$ (1,787)"",""$ (4,971)""\n30,Non-Cash Financing Activities,,,\n31,Short-term debts from subsidiaries and affiliates,-,-,""4,971""\n32,Proceeds from long-term debt,$ -,""$ 1,787"",$ -\n }\n\n\n\n\nITEM 9.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n""Management\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,"" which sets forth management\'s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, and the ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 are set forth in ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""\nITEM 9B.

DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 38] Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\nDuring 2022, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for obligations arising out of local Card Members\' spending outside\n\n\n\nsuch country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members\' currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB\'s capital levels. The FDIA\'s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately $4.6 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\n\n\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive offices are in a 2.2 million square foot building located in lower Manhattan on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in 2069. We have an approximately 49 percent ownership interest in the building and an affiliate of Brookfield Financial Properties owns the remaining approximately 51 percent interest in the building. We also lease space in the building from Brookfield\'s affiliate.\nOther owned or leased principal locations include American Express offices in Phoenix, Arizona, Sunrise, Florida, Gurgaon, India, Brighton, England, Manila, Philippines, Tokyo, Japan, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Sydney, Australia; the American Express data centers in Phoenix, Arizona and Greensboro, North Carolina; the headquarters for AENB in Sandy, Utah; the headquarters for American Express Services Europe Limited in London, England; the headquarters for American Express Europe, S.A. in Madrid, Spain; the headquarters for Amex Bank of Canada and Amex Canada Inc. in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and the headquarters for American Express Bank (Mexico) S.A.

Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.

Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See ""Dividends and Share Repurchases"" below.\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.\nWe seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company\'s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries.\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.\n\n\n\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022:\nTABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,Effective Minimum (a),""Ratios as of December 31, 2022""\n1,Risk-Based Capital,,\n2,Common Equity Tier 1,7.0%,\n3,American Express Company,,10.3 %\n4,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n5,Tier 1,8.5,\n6,American Express Company,,11.1\n7,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n8,Total,10.5,\n9,American Express Company,,12.8\n10,American Express National Bank,,13.2\n11,Tier 1 Leverage,4.0%,\n12,American Express Company,,9.9\n13,American Express National Bank,,9.7%\n }\n\n(a) Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for AENB.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders\' equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below.\n\n\n\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information on our preferred shares.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio - Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to ""Capital and Liquidity Regulation"" under Part 1, Item 1. ""Business - Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.\nAs a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve\'s supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 120] ASSET SECURITIZATIONS\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts, American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust and together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.\nThe Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts' economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. Our ownership of variable interests in the Lending Trust was $16.0 billion and $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and in the Charge Trust was $5.2 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts.\nThe debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8).\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust was $59 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and by the Charge Trust was nil and $1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.\nUnder the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such triggering events occurred.\n\n\n\nNOTE 6\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 150] REGULATORY MATTERS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\nWe are supervised and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and are subject to the Federal Reserve\'s requirements for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), is subject to supervision and regulation, including regulatory capital and leverage requirements, by the OCC.\nUnder the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets).\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our operating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we met all capital requirements to which we were subject and maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as well capitalized.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital ratios:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n0,""(Millions, except percentages)"",CET 1 capital,Tier 1 capital,Total capital,CET 1 capital ratio,Tier 1 capital ratio,Total capital ratio,Tier 1 leverage ratio\n1,""December 31, 2022: (a)"",,,,,,,\n2,American Express Company,""$ 20,030"",""$ 21,627"",""$ 24,926"",10.3%,11.1 %,12.8 %,9.9%\n3,American Express National Bank,""$ 14,820"",""$ 14,820"",""$ 17,273"",11.3 ° %,11.3 %,13.2 %,9.7 %\n4,""December 31, 2021: (a)"",,,,,,,\n5,American Express Company,""$ 17,554"",""$ 19,186"",""$ 21,506"",10.5 %,11.5 %,12.9 %,10.5 %\n6,American Express National Bank,""$ 13,085"",""$ 13,085"",""$ 15,283"",11.8 %,11.8 %,13.7 %,10.5 %\n7,Well-capitalized ratios (b),,,,,,,\n8,American Express Company,,,,N/A,6.0 %,10.0 %,N/A\n9,American Express National Bank,,,,6.5 %,8.0 %,10.0 %,5.0 %\n10,Minimum capital ratios (c),,,,4.5 %,6.0 %,8.0 %,4.0 %\n11,Effective Minimum (d),,,,,,,\n12,American Express Company,,,,7.0 %,8.5 %,10.5 %,4.0 %\n13,American Express National Bank,,,,7.0 %,8.5 %,10.5 %,4.0 %\n }\n\n(a) Capital ratios reported using Basel III capital definitions and risk-weighted assets using the Basel III standardized approach.

Risk management for these balances is governed by our Asset and Liability Management Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our most significant concentration of credit risk was with individuals. These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, we review each potential customer's credit application and evaluate the applicant's financial history and ability and willingness to repay. We also consider credit performance by customer tenure, industry and geographic location in managing credit exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $350 billion and $327 billion, respectively of unused credit, primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements, of which approximately 80 percent was related to customers within the United States in both periods. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit.\n\n\n\nNOTE 24\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 88] CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

The increase in the pretax loss was primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year, a non-cash gain in the prior year related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value and higher compensation costs in the current year.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 45] BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic. Spending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis¹ Billed business, which represented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed business grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise customers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent year-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending momentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the large pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our international billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased 36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a modest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased versus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in 2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\n1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy.\nDuring the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.\nOur performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and our strategy, and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on delivering sustainable and profitable growth.\nSee ""Supervision and Regulation"" in ""Business"" for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for information on potential impacts of economic, geopolitical and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 96] CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""Year Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts)"",2022,2021,2020\n1,Revenues,,,\n2,Non-interest revenues,,,\n3,Discount revenue,""$ 30,739"",""$ 24,563"",""$ 19,435""\n4,Net card fees,""6,070"",""5,195"",""4,664""\n5,Service fees and other revenue,""4,521"",""3,316"",""2,702""\n6,Processed revenue,""1,637"",""1,556"",""1,301""\n7,Total non-interest revenues,""42,967"",""34,630"",""28,102""\n8,Interest income,,,\n9,Interest on loans,""11,967"",""8,850"",""9,779""\n10,Interest and dividends on investment securities,96,83,127\n11,Deposits with banks and other,595,100,177\n12,Total interest income,""12,658"",""9,033"",""10,083""\n13,Interest expense,,,\n14,Deposits,""1,527"",458,943\n15,Long-term debt and other,""1,236"",825,""1,155""\n16,Total interest expense,""2,763"",""1,283"",""2,098""\n17,Net interest income,""9,895"",""7,750"",""7,985""\n18,Total revenues net of interest expense,""52,862"",""42,380"",""36,087""\n19,Provisions for credit losses,,,\n20,Card Member receivables,627,(73),""1,015""\n21,Card Member loans,""1,514"",""(1,155)"",""3,453""\n22,Other,41,(191),262\n23,Total provisions for credit losses,""2,182"",""(1,419)"",""4,730""\n24,Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses,""50,680"",""43,799"",""31,357""\n25,Expenses,,,\n26,Card Member rewards,""14,002"",""11,007"",""8,041""\n27,Business development,""4,943"",""3,762"",""3,051""\n28,Card Member services,""2,959"",""1,993"",""1,230""\n29,Marketing,""5,458"",""5,291"",""3,696""\n30,Salaries and employee benefits,""7,252"",""6,240"",""5,718""\n31,""Other, net"",""6,481"",""4,817"",""5,325""\n32,Total expenses,""41,095"",""33,110"",""27,061""\n33,Pretax income,""9,585"",""10,689"",""4,296""\n34,Income tax provision,""2,071"",""2,629"",""1,161""\n35,Net income,""$ 7,514"",""$ 8,060"",""$ 3,135""\n36,Earnings per Common Share - (Note 21)(a),,,\n37,Basic,$ 9.86,$ 10.04,$ 3.77\n38,Diluted,$ 9.85,$ 10.02,$ 3.77\n39,Average common shares outstanding for earnings per common share:,,,\n40,Basic,751,789,805\n41,Diluted,752,790,806\n }\n\n(a) Represents net income less (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $57 million, $56 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $57 million, $71 million and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and (iii) equity-related adjustments of $16 million related to the redemption of preferred shares for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 154] Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology.

Fiscal 2017 activity is primarily related to the sale of remaining Five Star property assets that were held for sale as of January 30, 2016.\nFiscal 2019 had no financial results from discontinued operations.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 31] Segment Performance Summary\nDomestic Segment\nThe following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Domestic Segment Performance Summary,2019,2018,2017\n1,Revenue,""$ 39,304"",""$ 38,662"",""$ 36,248""\n2,Revenue % increase (decrease),1.7%,6.7%,(0.3)%\n3,Comparable sales growth (1),4.8%,5.6%,0.2%\n4,Gross profit,""$ 9,144"",""$ 9,065"",""$ 8,650""\n5,Gross profit as % of revenue,23.3%,23.4%,23.9 9\n6,SG&A,""$ 7,300"",""$ 7,304"",""$ 6,855""\n7,SG&A as % of revenue,18.6%,18.9%,18.9\n8,Restructuring charges,$ 47,$ 9,$ 31\n9,Operating income,""$ 1,797"",""$ 1,752"",""$ 1,764""\n10,Operating income as % of revenue,4.6%,4.5%,4.9%\n11,,,,\n12,Selected Online Revenue Data,,,\n13,Total online revenue,""$ 6,528"",""$ 5,991"",""$ 4,843""\n14,Online revenue as a % of total segment revenue,16.6%,15.5%,13.4%\n15,Comparable online sales growth (1),10.5%,21.8%,20.8%\n16,,,,29\n }\n\n\n\n\n(1) Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.

Settlements relate to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years. (5) Included within operating income and net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 is $201 million ($159 million net of taxes) of restructuring charges from continuing operations recorded in fiscal 2016 related to measures we took to restructure our business. Net earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc. shareholders for fiscal 2016 includes restructuring charges (net of tax and noncontrolling interest) from continuing operations. (6) Included within net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc. shareholders for fiscal 2015 includes $353 million due to a discrete benefit related to reorganizing certain European legal entities. (7) Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019. (8) The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities.

Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $379 million and $269 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms ""Best Buy,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.\nDescription of Business\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers\' everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (""Current Health"") and Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (""Yardbird""). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks.\nSegment Information\nOur business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business) and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada). Our chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable segment.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within SG&A.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""January 28, 2023"",""January 29, 2022"",""January 30, 2021""\n1,Cash and cash equivalents,""$ 1,874"",""$ 2,936"",""$ 5,494""\n2,Restricted cash included in Other current assets,379,269,131\n3,""Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"",""$ 2,253"",""$ 3,205"",""$ 5,625""\n }\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in restricted cash are primarily restricted to use for product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 60] Receivables\nReceivables consist primarily of amounts due from vendors for various vendor funding programs, banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions and mobile phone network operators for device sales and commissions. We establish allowances for uncollectible receivables based primarily on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $23 million and $37 million at February 2, 2019 , and February 3, 2018 respectively.\n [source page: 60] Merchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value and the weighted average method is used to determine the cost of inventory. The costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers are included as part of the net cost of merchandise inventories. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cost of goods sold.\nOur inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated.\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of inventory and establishes a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 42] Restricted Cash\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability insurance claims.

We do not amortize our indefinite-lived tradenames, but test for impairment annually, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived tradename.

Acquisition\nGreatCall, Inc.\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall for net cash consideration of $787 million GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers, offers easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices, tailored for seniors. These products are combined with a range of services, including a simple, one-touch connection to U.S.-based, specially-trained agents who can connect the user to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. The acquisition of GreatCall is aligned with our strategy to address health and wellness with a focus on aging consumers and how technology can help them live more independent lives.\nThe acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the cost was allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. All of the goodwill was assigned to our Domestic reportable segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded $13 million of transaction costs in fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition within SG&A expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operations from the date of acquisition were included within our Domestic reportable segment and our Services revenue category. The acquisition of GreatCall was not material to the results of our operations.\nThe purchase price allocation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete, but may be subject to immaterial change through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020.

Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for expected credit losses, which is primarily based on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $30 million and $39 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We had $41 million and $52 million of write-offs in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\n [source page: 45] Merchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted-average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which includes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of sales on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of inventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis.\nOur inventory valuation reflects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft).

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.\n [source page: 32] Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nMarkdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition.

These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure.

We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate There is judgment in (1) measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions A 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023. The amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous Total Tech Support offer.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 32] Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow (""DCF"") models and market data, such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. DCF models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.\n [source page: 32] Effects if actual results differ from assumptions\nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Compared to fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy\'s market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote.\nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. In fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more significantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue growth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the more uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher than for our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 23] Overview\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life.

The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019.

The components of the 6.7% revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2018 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Comparable sales impact,5.3%\n1,Non-comparable sales impact (1),1.4%\n2,Total revenue increase,6.7%\n }\n\n\n\n\n(1) Non-comparable sales reflect the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018, as well as the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as profit-share revenue, certain credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Non-comparable sales also reflect the impact of net store opening and closing activity of (0.7)% in fiscal 2018.\nThe profit-share revenue included in our non-comparable sales relates to our extended warranty protection plans that are managed by a third-party underwriter. We may be eligible to receive profit-sharing payments, depending on the performance of the portfolio. When performance of the portfolio is strong and the claims cost to the third-party underwriter declines, we are entitled to share in the excess premiums. In fiscal 2018, we recognized $59 million of such profit-share revenue, with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income. In fiscal 2017, we recognized $110 million of such profit-share revenue. The fiscal 2018 profit-share revenue decrease from fiscal 2017 reflects reductions to the premiums that we pay to the third-party underwriter.\nIn fiscal 2018, Domestic segment online revenue of $6.0 billion increased 21.8% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased to 15.5% versus 13.4% in fiscal 2017.\nThe following table presents the Domestic segment\'s revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2018 and 2017\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Revenue Mix,Summary,Comparable,Sales Summary\n1,,Year,Ended,Year,Ended\n2,,""February 3, 2018"",""January 28, 2017"",""February 3, 2018"",""January 28, 2017""\n3,Computing and Mobile Phones,45%,45%,5.3%,(1.8)%\n4,Consumer Electronics,33%,34%,3.1%,5.0 o\n5,Appliances,10%,9%,11.4%,7.8%\n6,Entertainment,8%,7%,12.6%,(13.8)%\n7,Services,4%,5%,4.0%,(3.3)%\n8,Total,100%,100%,5.6%,0.2 %\n }\n\nWe believe the strong execution of our business strategy, combined with better product availability, a continued healthy consumer confidence, positive macro conditions and a favorable competitive environment contributed to our Domestic comparable sales growth across most of our categories. The following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our Domestic segment by revenue category:\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 5.3% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and wearables, partially offset by tablets. Consumer Electronics: The 3.1% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by smart home, home theater, headphones and voice assistants, partially offset by health and fitness. Appliances: The 11.4% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by large and small appliances. Entertainment: The 12.6% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming hardware. Services: The 4.0% comparable sales growth was primarily driven by continued growth in our warranty business, and higher installation and delivery services.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit rate to 23.4% in fiscal 2018 from 23.9% in fiscal 2017. This rate decrease was primarily due to the $183 million of cathode ray tube (""CRT"") settlement proceeds recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a decrease in our periodic profit-share revenue as described above, partially offset by improved margin rates across multiple categories.\nOur Domestic segment SG&A rate remained flat at 18.9% of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. SG&A increased in fiscal 2018 due to (1) higher incentive compensation for store and corporate employees, (2) investments in growth initiatives, (3) the impact of the extra week, (4) one-time expenses related to tax reform, which included $75 million related to employee bonus expense and a $20 million charitable donation to the Best Buy Foundation, and (5) higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were offset by cost reductions and $22 million in CRT settlement legal fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that did not recur in fiscal 2018.\nOur Domestic segment incurred $9 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 and $31 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2017. The restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 related to the Best Buy Mobile plan that began in the fourth quarter of\n\n\n\nfiscal 2018, whereas the charges in fiscal 2017 related primarily to the Renew Blue Phase 2 plan that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 9, Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our restructuring activities.\nOur Domestic segment\'s operating income decreased $12 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. In addition, the operating income rate decreased to 4.5% of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to 4.9% of revenue in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the gross profit rate decline and increase in SG&A described above.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 27] Overview\nWe strive to enrich the lives of consumers through technology, whether they connect with us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We do this by solving technology problems and addressing key human needs across a range of areas, including entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., including GreatCall. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 included 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\n\n\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.\nThe Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. However, we have not provided International comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018.

We provide a license to our brand and marketing services, and we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks are the sole owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables related to these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions with customers. We are eligible to receive a profit share from certain of our banking partner based on the annual performance of the program, and we receive quarterly payments based on forecasts of full-year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record such profit share as revenue over time using the most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit-share payments occur quarterly, shortly after the end of each program quarter.\nBest Buy Gift Cards\nWe sell Best Buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do not expire. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed (""breakage""). We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns. Typically, over 90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90% of gift card breakage revenue) occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage income was $34 million , $40 million and $37 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 25] Consolidated Results\nSelected consolidated financial data was as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Consolidated Performance Summary,2023,2022,2021\n1,Revenue,""$ 46,298"",""$ 51,761"",""$ 47,262""\n2,Revenue % change,(10.6)%,9.5%,8.3%\n3,Comparable sales % change,(9.9)%,10.4 %,9.7%\n4,Gross profit,""$ 9,912"",""$ 11,640"",""$ 10,573""\n5,Gross profit as a % of revenue¹,21.4%,22.5 °,22.4 %\n6,SG&A,""$ 7,970"",""$ 8,635"",""$ 7,928""\n7,SG&A as a % of revenue (1),17.2\',16.7 9,16.8 %\n8,Restructuring charges,$ 147,$ (34),$ 254\n9,Operating income,""$ 1,795"",""$ 3,039"",""$ 2,391""\n10,Operating income as a % of revenue,3.9 %,5.9 %,5.1 %\n11,Net earnings,""$ 1,419"",""$ 2,454"",""$ 1,798""\n12,Diluted earnings per share,$ 6.29,$ 9.84,$ 6.84\n }\n\n(1) Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers\' corresponding rates.

Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at- home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.\nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment. For further discussion of each segment\'s rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 32] Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n [source page: 32] Tax Contingencies\n [source page: 32] Description\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 8] Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2019, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64% of the merchandise we purchased (70% in fiscal 2018), with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG - representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased (56% in fiscal 2018). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value\n\n\n\nand depend upon, to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms.\nWe are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry, may negatively impact our operations.\nWe operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to field employee hourly wage rates, along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates, could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 5] Seasonality\nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\n [source page: 5] Working Capital\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n [source page: 5] Competition\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in our stores and in their homes, and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs, provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our broad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs; our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 47] Service Revenue\n [source page: 47] Description\nWe sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support, extended warranty, anti-virus software and one-time service repairs. We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For technical support membership contracts, we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method is based on historical utilization patterns.\n [source page: 47] Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThere is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; and, (2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and, (3) assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When insufficient history of usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of February 2, 2019, , would have affected net earnings by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2019\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 42] Restricted Cash\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability insurance claims.
