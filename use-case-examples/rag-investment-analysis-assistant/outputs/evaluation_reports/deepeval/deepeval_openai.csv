Management has determined that the Food Safety Division split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions (the split-off and certain internal business separation transactions referred to together as the ""Transactions"") qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, management applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed Transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the financial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s determination of the tax-free treatment of the Transactions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the information, including the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, U.S. federal tax law, other external tax advice, certain representations from management, and other relevant evidence used by management, as well as the application of relevant U.S. federal tax law to support management\'s determination that the Transactions qualify as tax-free.\n\n\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill Impairment Assessments for the Advanced Materials Division As described in Notes 1, 4, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\'s consolidated property, plant and equipment balance was $9.2 billion and goodwill balance was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the Advanced Materials Division makes up a portion of these balances. Management tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Management also tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. In December 2022, the Company committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to the impairment of long-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion) for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rate and other applicable items.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the appropriateness of management\'s discounted cash flow models and reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division, including controls over management\'s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment of an asset group or reporting unit has occurred and controls over the determination of the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\'s process for determining the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate. Evaluating management\'s assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, and capital expenditures involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the Advanced Materials Division, external market and industry data, evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the Company\'s objectives and strategies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 8, 2023 We have served as the Company\'s auditor since 1975.\n\n\n\n3M Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statement of Income Years ended December 31\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""(Millions, except per share amounts)"",2022,2021,2020\n1,Net sales,""$ 34,229"",""$ 35,355"",""$ 32,184""\n2,,,,\n3,Operating expenses,,,\n4,Cost of sales,""19,232"",""18,795"",""16,605""\n5,""Selling, general and administrative expenses"",""9,049"",""7,197"",""6,929""\n6,""Research, development and related expenses"",""1,862"",""1,994"",""1,878""\n7,Gain on business divestitures,""(2,724)"",-,(389)\n8,Goodwill impairment expense,271,-,-\n9,Total operating expenses,""27,690"",""27,986"",""25,023""\n10,Operating income,""6,539"",""7,369"",""7,161""\n11,,,,\n12,""Other expense (income), net"",147,165,366\n13,,,,\n14,Income before income taxes,""6,392"",""7,204"",""6,795""\n15,Provision for income taxes,612,""1,285"",""1,337""\n16,Income of consolidated group,""5,780"",""5,919"",""5,458""\n17,,,,\n18,""Income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes"",11,10,(5)\n19,Net income including noncontrolling interest,""5,791"",""5,929"",""5,453""\n20,,,,\n21,Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest,14,8,4\n22,,,,\n23,Net income attributable to 3M,""$ 5,777"",""$ 5,921"",""$ 5,449""\n24,,,,\n25,Weighted average 3M common shares outstanding -

Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term ""3M"" or ""Company"" refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 16.\nBasis of presentation: Certain amounts in the prior years\' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M\'s disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Exceptions include 3M\'s subsidiaries in Argentina and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, in Turkey, the economy of which also became highly inflationary. The operating income and balances of underlying net monetary assets denominated in Turkish lira are not material to 3M. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders\' equity.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nMarketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\' equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\nInvestments: All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\n\n\n\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance policies are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in ""Purchases of marketable securities and investments"" and ""Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,"" respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range ftwenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range offive to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $177 million and $176 millions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not ""more likely than not"" less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as ""Step 0"". 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.\nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from six to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset\'s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between twelve to nineteen years, patents largely between eight to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between six to ten years, definite lived tradenames largely betweeneleve and twenty years, and other intangibles largely ten years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Company\'s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within ""Research, development and related expenses.""\n\n\n\nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\'s or asset group\'s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees\' remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M\'s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company\'s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract\'s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M\'s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nThe Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.\nThe Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.\n\n\n\n3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:\nExemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less. Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration. ""Right to invoice"" practical expedient based on 3M\'s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3M\'s performance completed to date. Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes. Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of ASC 842,Leases. The Company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.\nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and totaled $323 million, $327 million and $278 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures.\nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software\'s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.\nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\'s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $115 million and $142 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740,Income Taxes.\n\n\n\nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company\'s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti- dilutive effect (30.3 million average options for 2022,7. million average options for 2021, and 18.1 million average options for 2020). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share follow:\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 109] NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies\nCapital and Operating Leases:\nRental expense under operating leases was $393 million in 2018, $343 million in 2017 and $318 million in 2016. It is 3M\'s practice to secure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has the following primary capital leases:\nIn 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 34 million British Pound (GBP), or approximately $43 million at December 31, 2018, exchange rates, for a building in the United Kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years). 3M sold and leased-back certain recently constructed machinery and equipment in return for municipal securities, which in aggregate, were recorded as a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $13 million in 2018, $13 million in 2017, and $12 million in 2016, with an average remaining lease term remaining of 15 years at December 31, 2018.\n\n\nMinimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:\nOperating\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,(Millions),Capital Leases,Operating Leases\n1,2019,$ 18,$ 283\n2,2020,16,208\n3,2021,14,153\n4,2022,12,122\n5,2023,12,92\n6,After 2023,32,253\n7,Total,$ 104,""$ 1,111""\n8,Less: Amounts representing interest,12,\n9,Present value of future minimum lease payments,92,\n10,Less: Current obligations under capital leases,17,\n11,Long-term obligations under capital leases,$ 75,\n }\n\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations:\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2018, at $663 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows: 2019 ($244 million), 2020 ($216 million), 2021 ($131 million), 2022 ($40 million), 2023 ($15 million) and after 2023 ($17 million). Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these\n\n\n\nunconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\'s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company\'s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 37] Total debt:\nThe strength of 3M\'s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\'s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company\'s total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\'s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nAs disclosed in Note 12, 3M had debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 63] Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets, in addition to the balance of non-amortizable intangible assets follow:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,December,""31,""\n1,(Millions),2022,2021\n2,Customer related intangible assets,""$ 4,062"",""$ 4,216""\n3,Patents,426,513\n4,Other technology-based intangible assets,""2,081"",""2,111""\n5,Definite-lived tradenames,""1,166"",""1,171""\n6,Other amortizable intangible assets,84,105\n7,Total gross carrying amount,""7,819"",""8,116""\n8,,,\n9,Accumulated amortization - customer related,""(1,747)"",""(1,616)""\n10,Accumulated amortization - patents,(421),(500)\n11,Accumulated amortization - other technology-based,""(1,000)"",(839)\n12,Accumulated amortization - definite-lived tradenames,(509),(447)\n13,Accumulated amortization - other,(60),(79)\n14,Total accumulated amortization,""(3,737)"",""(3,481)""\n15,,,\n16,Total finite-lived intangible assets - net,""4,082"",""4,635""\n17,,,\n18,Non-amortizable intangible assets (primarily tradenames),617,653\n19,Total intangible assets - net,""$ 4,699"",""$ 5,288""\n }\n\n\n\n\nCertain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 60 years, have a history of leading-market share positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an indefinite period of time.\nAs discussed in Note 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M\'s commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to impairment of long-lived assets and an immaterial charge related to impairment of indefinite-lived assets.\nAmortization expense follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nExpected amortization expense for acquired amortizable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate.

As discussed in Note 19 (Business Segments), gains/losses on business divestitures are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n2022 divestitures and previously announced divestitures:\nIn March 2022, 3M completed the sale of its floor products business in Western Europe, formerly part of the Consumer business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position ofl 9.9% in the business, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The Company expects to complete the transaction, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, by year-end 2023. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including final approval from the 3M Board of Directors, regulatory approvals and rulings, and satisfactory completion of financing, among other items. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\nIn September 2022, 3M completed the split-off and combination of its Food Safety Division business (formerly part of the Health Care business segment) with Neogen Corporation in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure intended to make the split-off tax-efficient to 3M and 3M's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the transaction, 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion based on aggregate consideration of $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the underlying agreements, aggregate consideration included 3M shares exchanged and $1.0 billion ($828 million after closing and other adjustments) funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. The cash and non-cash consideration components are further described below.\n$2.0 billion representing the value of 16 million 3M common shares accepted by 3M that reduced shares outstanding through a fully-subscribed exchange offer. The exchange ultimately resulted in subscribed 3M shareholders owning 50.1% of the common shares of Neogen. $828 million in cash and non-cash components funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. $478 million, net of divested cash, as a cash payment to 3M funded from Food Safety business borrowings coincident with the transaction that became obligations of Neogen. This amount is reflected in the investing section on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amount was subject to closing and other adjustments and included cash paid to 3M for direct sales of certain net assets of the Food Safety business to Neogen. $350 million as part of a non-cash debt-for-debt exchange that reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness and became new term-debt obligations of Neogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M determined that the split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, 3M applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Reverse Morris Trust split-off transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nNet sales information relative to the Food Safety Division is included in Note 2. Neogen and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition supply, manufacturing and services and into certain longer-term commercial supply and distributor arrangements.\n2021 divestitures:\nThere were no divestitures that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 73] Non-Designated Hedges\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.\nInventory increased $387 million from December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increased underlying operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.

Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable.

Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016.

Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\'s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.\nIn 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points.

This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018.\n [source page: 28] Research, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D in dollars decreased $49 million for full year 2018 when compared to the same period last year. The decrease primarily relates to R&D no longer incurred related to the Communication Markets Division, which was primarily divested in the second quarter of 2018 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.6 percent in 2018, compared to 5.9 percent in 2017 and 2016.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Total Debt:\nThe strength of 3M\'s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\'s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\'s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service.\nThe Company\'s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\' discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 26] Financial condition:\n3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In November 2018, 3M\'s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\'s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company\'s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February 2019, 3M\'s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor\'s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody\'s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 32] Corporate and Unallocated:\nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to ""Corporate and Unallocated,"" which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 18. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of legal fees and other related\n\n\n\nobligations, was reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, 3M\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased year-on-year.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $74 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company\'s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 44] Balance Sheet:\n3M\'s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.\nWorking Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,December,""31,"",2018 versus\n1,(Millions),2018,2017,2017\n2,Current assets,""$ 13,709"",""$ 14,277"",$ (568)\n3,Less: Current liabilities,""7,244"",""7,687"",(443)\n4,Working capital (non-GAAP measure),""$ 6,465"",""$ 6,590"",$ (125)\n }\n\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $125 million compared with December 31, 2017. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $568 million, driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $443 million, primarily due to decreases in short-term debt.\nAccounts receivable increased $109 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased sales. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 accounts receivable by $166 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased accounts receivable by $29 million. Inventory increased $332 million from December 31, 2017, impacted by maintenance of additional inventory during\n\n\n\nthe deployment in the U.S. of the Company\'s ERP system. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 inventory by $154 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased inventory by $23 million.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 71] Note 2. Revenue\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related standards (collectively, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily\n\n\n\nrelating to the accelerated recognition for software installation service and training revenue. This cumulative impact reflects retrospective application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Further, the Company applied the practical expedient permitting the effect of all contract modifications that occurred before January 1, 2018 to be aggregated in the transition accounting. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n [source page: 72] Contract Balances:\nDeferred revenue (current portion) as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $617 million and $513 million, respectively, and primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts, the changes in balance of which are related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of these contracts. The balance also contains a deferral for goods that are in-transit at period end for which control transfers to the customer upon delivery. Approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2017 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions:\n3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M\'s acquisition of these businesses.\nIn addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during 2018.\n\n\n\nIn February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal for cash of approximately $0.7 billion, subject to closing and other adjustments, and assumption of approximately $0.3 billion of M*Modal\'s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare technology provider of cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient narrative. The transaction will be reflected within the Company\'s Health Care business.\n2017 acquisitions:\nIn September 2017, 3M purchased all of the ownership interests of Elution Technologies, LLC, a Vermont-based manufacturer of test kits that help enable food and beverage companies ensure their products are free from certain potentially harmful allergens such as peanuts, soy or milk. Elution is reported within the Company\'s Health Care business.\nIn October 2017, 3M completed the acquisition of the underlying legal entities and associated assets of Scott Safety, which is headquartered in Monroe, North Carolina, from Johnson Controls for $2.0 billion of cash, net of cash acquired. Scott Safety is a premier manufacturer of innovative products, including self-contained breathing apparatus systems, gas and flame detection instruments, and other safety devices that complement 3M\'s personal safety portfolio. The business had revenues of approximately $570 million in 2016. Scott Safety is reported within 3M\'s Safety and Graphics business. Adjustments in 2018 to the purchase price allocation were approximately $7 million and related to identification of certain immaterial acquired assets, tax- related and contingent liabilities, and resolution of certain acquired working capital and other purchase price adjustments with the seller. The change to provisional amounts did not result in material impacts to results of operations in 2018 or any portion related to earlier quarters in the measurement period. The allocation of purchase consideration related to Scott Safety was completed in the third quarter of 2018.\nPro forma information related to acquisitions has not been included because the impact on the Company\'s consolidated results of operations was not considered material.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n"", ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 21] Foreign exchange impacts:\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income by approximately $271 million and $103 million (or a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $280 million and $119 million) year-on-year for 2022 and 2021, respectively. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nOther expense (income), net:\nLower income related to higher non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense increased expense year-on-year for 2022. Higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-on-year for 2021. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same period year-on-year due in part to interest expense savings from early debt extinguishment actions in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax rate:\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the Food Safety business (see Note 3). The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 17.7 percent, 18.1 percent, and 20.5 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 0.4 percent percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 2.4 percentage points from 2020 to 2021.\n\n\nShares of common stock outstanding:\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share per diluted share for 2022, while higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share diluted share for 2021.\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Operating income, segment operating income (loss), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. While the Company includes certain items in its measure of segment operating performance, it also considers these non- GAAP measures in evaluating and managing its operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is useful to investors in understanding underlying business performance, while also providing additional transparency to the special items. Special items impacting operating income are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed the extent of matters and charges/benefits it includes within special items with respect to net costs for significant litigation. Previously, 3M included net costs, when significant, associated with changes in accrued liabilities related to respirator mask/asbestos litigation and PFAS-related other environmental matters, along with the associated tax impacts. These non-GAAP measure changes involved including net costs for litigation related to 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs, expanding net costs to include external legal fees and insurance recoveries associated with the applicable matters in addition to changes in accrued liabilities, and to include all such net costs for the applicable matters, not just when considered significant. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nSpecial items for the periods presented include:\nNet costs for significant litigation:\nThese relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 16). Net costs include the impacts of any changes in accrued liabilities, external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with associated tax impacts. Prior to initiating voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters along with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. During the bankruptcy period, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continue to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Net costs associated with PFAS-related other environmental matters are primarily reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated.\nDivestiture costs:\nThese include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 40] 2021 Debt Activity:\nDecreases in debt were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption of $450 million in debt maturing in 2022 via make-whole call offers and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in ""Change in short-term debt - net"" in the preceding table.\nRepurchases of Common Stock:\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company\'s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2022, the Company purchased $1,464 million of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled ""Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company\'s stock.\n\n\n\nDividends Paid to Shareholders:\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2023, 3M\'s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $6.00 per share and marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 28] PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\nItem 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M\'s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M\'s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company\'s business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n\n\n [source page: 29] Corporate and Unallocated:\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to ""Corporate and Unallocated,"" which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes ""corporate special items"" and ""other corporate expense-net"". Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation associated with Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters during the chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022) and with PFAS-related other environmental matters (see Note 16). Corporate special items also include divestiture costs, gain/loss on business divestitures (see Note 3), divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5), and Russia exit costs (see Note 15). Divestiture costs include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from transition supply, manufacturing and service arrangements with Neogen Corporation following the split-off of 3M\'s Food Safety business in 2022 and with the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased in 2022, when compared to the same period last year. The subsections below provide additional information.\nCorporate Special Items\nRefer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)section for additional details on the impact of special items and to Note 19 for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased in 2022 year over year primarily due to the gain on divestiture associated with the 2022 split-off of the Food Safety business (discussed in Note 3) partially offset by additional commitments in 2022 to address PFAS-related matters, including at 3M\'s Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16).\nOther Corporate Expense Net\nOther corporate operating expenses, net, increased when compared to the same period last year primarily due to a $91 million pre-tax benefit from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court included in the second quarter of 2021 regarding the calculation of past social taxes.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 21] Organic growth/productivity and other:\nIn 2022, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year: Declines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3 percent and earnings per share by $0.29. Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year benefit $0.85 to earnings per share and 1.3 percent to operating margins which was impacted by the following: Benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline and 2021 restructuring actions Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges; geopolitical impacts due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict as well as ongoing COVID- related challenges in China Second quarter of 2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court regarding the calculation of past social taxes Increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability In 2021, organic volume growth and ongoing cost management increased operating income margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year offset by manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges and increased compensation/benefit costs.

Additionally, the Company\'s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company\'s total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\'s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nAs disclosed in Note 12, 3M had debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 63] Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets, in addition to the balance of non-amortizable intangible assets follow:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,December,""31,""\n1,(Millions),2022,2021\n2,Customer related intangible assets,""$ 4,062"",""$ 4,216""\n3,Patents,426,513\n4,Other technology-based intangible assets,""2,081"",""2,111""\n5,Definite-lived tradenames,""1,166"",""1,171""\n6,Other amortizable intangible assets,84,105\n7,Total gross carrying amount,""7,819"",""8,116""\n8,,,\n9,Accumulated amortization - customer related,""(1,747)"",""(1,616)""\n10,Accumulated amortization - patents,(421),(500)\n11,Accumulated amortization - other technology-based,""(1,000)"",(839)\n12,Accumulated amortization - definite-lived tradenames,(509),(447)\n13,Accumulated amortization - other,(60),(79)\n14,Total accumulated amortization,""(3,737)"",""(3,481)""\n15,,,\n16,Total finite-lived intangible assets - net,""4,082"",""4,635""\n17,,,\n18,Non-amortizable intangible assets (primarily tradenames),617,653\n19,Total intangible assets - net,""$ 4,699"",""$ 5,288""\n }\n\n\n\n\nCertain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 60 years, have a history of leading-market share positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an indefinite period of time.\nAs discussed in Note 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M\'s commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to impairment of long-lived assets and an immaterial charge related to impairment of indefinite-lived assets.\nAmortization expense follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nExpected amortization expense for acquired amortizable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,""Year ended December 31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2020\n2,Amortization expense,$ 498,$ 529,$ 537\n }\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,(Millions),2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,After 2027\n1,Amortization expense,$ 479,$ 451,$ 421,$ 415,$ 390,""$ 1,926""\n }\n\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate.

Further contingent consideration of less than $25 million may be recognized depending on outcomes in the future. The business, with annual sales of approximately $85 million, consists of ballistic helmets, body armor, flat armor and related helmet-attachment products serving government and law enforcement. 3M reflected immaterial impacts in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of measuring this disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and in the first quarter 2020 related to completion of the divestiture and recognition of contingent consideration.\nIn May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Drug Delivery Division business, formerly part of the Health Care business, to an affiliate of Altaris Capital Partners, LLC for $617 million in consideration including $487 million of cash, approximately $70 million in the form of an interest-bearing security, and approximately $60 million in the form of a 17 percent noncontrolling interest in the new company, Kindeva Drug Delivery (Kindeva). Non-cash consideration was valued at time of initial recognition on an income-based approach using relevant estimated future cash flows and applicable market interest rates while considering impacts of restrictions related to transferability. The divested business had annual sales of approximately $380 million. 3M retained its transdermal drug delivery components business. 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $387 million as a result of the divestiture. The Company reflected its ownership interest in Kindeva using the equity method of accounting incorporating the recording of 3M's share of earnings/losses on a lag-basis based on availability of Kindeva financial statements. As a result, income/loss from this unconsolidated subsidiary began to be reflected in 3M's financial statements in the third quarter of 2020. Kindeva and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition and supply services. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 3M sold its remaining ownership interest in Kindeva resulting in an immaterial gain.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, 3M completed the sale of a small dermatology products business, formerly part of the Health Care business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\nOperating income and held-for-sale amounts:\nWith respect to the businesses above, operating income information of the Health Care business segment, inclusive of the Food Safety Division and Drug Delivery Division, is included in Note 19.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $1.2 billion compared with December 31, 2021. Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.\nInventory increased $387 million from December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increased underlying operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts. Current portion of long-term debt increased as upcoming debt maturities now considered current were partially offset by the bond maturities in 2022, while accounts payable also increased as a result of increased sequential operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 39] Cash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow.

The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable decreased operating cash flow by $623 million in 2022, compared to an operating cash flow decrease of $507 million in 2021. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section. The 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) largely impacted the 2022 net income component above, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements.

Effective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made the following changes:\nChanges in measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M\'s disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Changes to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to theCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.\n\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this document. Given the diversity of 3M\'s businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Item 7. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M\'s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2022, 3M\'s costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measuressection below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). These matters are further discussed in Note 16. In 2022, 3M also completed the split-off of its Food Safety Division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in Note 15. SeeCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items.\n\n\n\n3M Belgium has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, as more fully discussed in Note16. As discussed in Note 16, 3M Belgium received agreement with authorities in June 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium has provided information required by the Flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done SO for production or sampling purposes. Belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. See further discussion in Note 16.\n3M is also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In light of a number of factors, 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022, the net sales of which were less than one percent of 3M\'s consolidated net sales for 2021. Further, in September 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. The associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in Note 15. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in Russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. Further supply disruption could lead to downstream customer impacts.\nThough 3M monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3M\'s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Relevant risk factors can be found in Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating income margin and earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted:\nThe following table provides the increases (decreases) in operating income margins and diluted earnings per share.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,,Year ended,""December 31,"",\n1,,2022,,2021,\n2,,Percent of net sales,Earnings per diluted share,Percent of net sales,Earnings per diluted share\n3,Same period last year,20.8 %,$ 10.12,22.3 %,$ 9.36\n4,Net costs for significant litigation,1.4,0.61,1.0,0.37\n5,Gain on business divestitures,-,-,(1.2),(0.52)\n6,Divestiture-related restructuring actions,-,-,0.2,0.08\n7,Total special items,1.4,0.61,-,(0.07)\n8,""Same period last year, excluding special items"",22.2,10.73,22.3,9.29\n9,Increase/(decrease) due to:,,,,\n10,Total organic growth/productivity and other,1.0,0.56,0.7,1.07\n11,Raw material impact,(2.4),(1.13),(0.8),(0.27)\n12,Divestitures,-,(0.05),-,(0.05)\n13,Foreign exchange impacts,-,(0.39),-,0.16\n14,""Other expense (income), net"",N/A,0.02,N/A,0.27\n15,Income tax rate,N/A,0.06,N/A,0.32\n16,Shares of common stock outstanding,N/A,0.30,N/A,(0.06)\n17,""Current period, excluding special items"",20.8,10.10,22.2,10.73\n18,Net costs for significant litigation,(6.7),(3.20),(1.4),(0.61)\n19,Divestiture costs,(0.2),(0.08),-,-\n20,Gain on business divestitures,8.0,4.73,-,-\n21,Divestiture-related restructuring actions,(0.1),(0.05),-,-\n22,Russia exit charges,(0.3),(0.20),-,-\n23,PFAS manufacturing exit costs,(2.4),(1.12),-,-\n24,Total special items,(1.7),0.08,(1.4),(0.61)\n25,Current period,19.1%,$ 10.18,20.8 %,$ 10.12\n }\n\nThe Company refers to various ""adjusted"" amounts or measures on an ""adjusted basis"".

However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award\'s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.\nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available- for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\'s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\'s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n\n\n\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\'s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 05,Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\nLeases: 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M\'s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M\'s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up tofive years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\nRelated Party Activity:\nOther than the amounts due by and between the Aearo Entities and related entities (as described in Note 16), 3M does not have any material related party activity.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 38] Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\nAt December 31, 2022, 3M had $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.7 billion was held by the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.2 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2021, 3M had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries and $1.7 billion was held by the United States. The decrease from December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from cash flow from operations and Food Safety transaction-related cash consideration and earlier borrowings (see Note 3) offset by ongoing dividend payments, purchases of treasury stock, capital expenditures, and the fixed- rate medium-term note maturities in 2022.\n [source page: 38] Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,December,""31,"",\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,Change\n2,Total debt,""$ 15,939"",""$ 17,363"",""$ (1,424)""\n3,""Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities"",""3,916"",""4,792"",(876)\n4,Net debt (non-GAAP measure),""$ 12,023"",""$ 12,571"",$ (548)\n }\n\nRefer to the preceding ""Total Debt"" and ""Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities"" sections for additional details.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 42] Interest Rates Risk:\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022 was $800 million. Additional details about 3M's long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company's long-term debt.\nCommodity Prices Risk:\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\n\n\n\nValue At Risk:\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company's sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at December 31, 2022. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Adverse impact on,after-tax earnings,Positive impact on,after-tax earnings\n1,(Millions),2022,2021,2022,2021\n2,Foreign exchange rates,$ (315),$ (140),$ 314,$ 147\n3,Interest rates,(18),(2),18,2\n4,Commodity prices,(5),(21),7,14\n }\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $85 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $45 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n"", ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 35] Assessments of Goodwill:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $12.8 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\n\n\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2022 completed as of October 1, 2022, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2022, 3M had 21 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\nFollowing the annual impairment test, as a result of 3M's December 2022 announced commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Notes 4 and 15, 3M tested the Advanced Materials and Electronics Materials Solutions reporting units (within the Transportation and Electronics business) for impairment resulting in a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit.\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2023 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 30] Debt and Capital\nAs of January 28, 2023, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (""2028 Notes"") and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030 (""2030 Notes"").

The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets.

Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.

These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.\nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.\nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\'s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\'s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\'s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, ,Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 46] Cash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow.

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Years ended December 31 (Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,""Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)"",""$ (1,577)"",""$ (1,373)"",""$ (1,420)""\n2,Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets,262,49,58\n3,""Acquisitions, net of cash acquired"",13,""(2,023)"",(16)\n4,""Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net"",669,(798),(163)\n5,""Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold"",846,""1,065"",142\n6,Other - net,9,(6),(4)\n7,Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,$ 222,""$ (3,086)"",""$ (1,403)""\n }\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 primarily relate to the sale of 3M\'s Communication Markets Division and the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring within the Safety and Graphics business segment.\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M\'s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 41] Asset Impairments:\nAs of December 31, 2018, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.7 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 3M\'s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\nAs of October 1, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more. 3M\'s market value at both December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\' equity of approximately $10 billion.\nAs discussed in Note 3, 3M sold its Communication Markets division in 2018, which comprised substantially all of the $272 million reduction in goodwill associated with divestitures during 2018.\nIn 2018, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were\n\n\n\nweighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\'s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\'s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\'s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\'s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n']",3.524988889694214,1.3468985557556152,4.587813377380371,9.920022010803224,29931,335,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The operating expenses for Adobe in fiscal 2022 were $9.34 billion, an increase of 15% from $8.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Despite this increase in operating expenses, the total revenue for Adobe in fiscal 2022 was $17.61 billion, up from $15.79 billion in fiscal 2021, representing a 12% increase. This revenue growth outpaced the growth in operating expenses, suggesting an improvement in operating efficiency and potentially a better operating margin.However, the specific operating margin figures are not directly provided in the provided context. To precisely determine whether the operating margin has improved, the actual operating income figures would be necessary, as operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by revenue. The improvement in revenue relative to the increase in operating expenses suggests a positive trend, but exact figures would be needed for confirmation.Regarding the usefulness of the operating margin as a metric for a company like Adobe, it remains a relevant and useful measure. Adobe operates in the software and digital services industry, where operating margins are critical for assessing operational efficiency and profitability. High operating margins are typical for software companies due to lower variable costs compared to physical goods companies. Therefore, monitoring changes in operating margin can provide valuable insights into Adobe's cost management, scalability, and overall financial health.For a complete analysis, reviewing the detailed financial statements and notes from Adobe's annual reports or SEC filings would provide the necessary data to calculate the exact operating margin and confirm these observations.

The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.\nIn February 2020, we issued $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2023, $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2030. Our total proceeds of approximately $3.14 billion, net of issuance discount, were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.\nOur senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nIn June 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (""Revolving Credit Agreement""), providing for a five-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement entered into in October 2018 (the ""Prior Revolving Credit Agreement""). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. At our election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at either the (i) term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), plus a margin, (ii) adjusted daily SOFR rate, plus a margin, (iii) alternative currency rate, plus a margin, or (iv) base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.500%, (b) the agent\'s prime rate, or (c) term SOFR plus 1.00%. The margin for term SOFR, adjusted daily SOFR, and alternative currency rate loans is based on our debt ratings, and ranges from 0.460% to 0.900%. In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt ratings are payable on the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an amount ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% per annum. We are permitted to permanently reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions.\nThe facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.\nAs of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with and at the time that we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement originally scheduled to expire in October 2023 was terminated. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement at the time of termination. There were no penalties paid as a result of the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Product\nCost of product revenue is primarily comprised of third-party royalties, localization costs and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.\n [source page: 43] Services and Other\nCost of services and other revenue is primarily comprised of compensation and contracted costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support, and hosting services and data center costs.

Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and\n\n\n [source page: 38] Table of Contents\nsyncing of files across users\' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (""ETLAs""), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (""DDOM"") and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Creative ARR,Annual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value\n1,Document Cloud ARR,Annual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services + Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\n2,Digital Media ARR,Creative ARR + Document Cloud ARR\n }\n\nIn March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.\nOur business is organized into the following reportable segments:\nDigital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers, communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers, and consumers. Digital Experience-Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. Publishing and Advertising-Our Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities, including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 4] SEGMENTS\nOur business is organized into three reportable segments:\nDigital Media; Digital Experience; and Publishing and Advertising.\n\n\n\nThese segments provide Adobe\'s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses.

Everyone has a story to tell, and they need the tools, services and capabilities at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In a creator economy that is continually expanding, creators are looking for tools to help them easily make and share unique and beautiful content with speed and ease. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team sport that is redefining productivity, making collaboration even more critical to every company\'s success. We believe Adobe is in a strong position to address these trends with innovation that will democratize creativity, empowering individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enabling more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.\nThe flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription service that allows members to use our creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators, enthusiasts, communicators and\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 68] Workfront\nOn December 7, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration.

If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable content, particularly misleading content intended to manipulate public opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better serve our customers and expand our customer base. Our brands may be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate newsworthy content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion (e.g., ""DeepFakes""), by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our products and services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, illegal content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation designed to address DeepFakes could adversely impact our product offerings.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 94] Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis SO that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary.

However, the context does include information on Adobe's cash flows and financial performance for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022, which can be used to infer trends in FCF conversion if the necessary data were available.To determine if Adobe's FCF conversion is improving, we would need specific figures for both net income and free cash flow for the fiscal year 2022. FCF conversion is calculated as (Free Cash Flow / Net Income) * 100, which indicates the percentage of net income converted into free cash flow.From the provided data, we know the net cash provided by operating activities and the net cash used for investing activities, but without explicit values for net income and total free cash flow for 2022, a direct calculation or comparison for FCF conversion improvement cannot be made.For a complete analysis, the exact figures for net income and free cash flow for 2022 would be required. If these figures were available, one could calculate the FCF conversion for 2022 and compare it with previous years to determine if there is an improvement.[Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] [source page: 68]","['<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 46] Tax-free Determination of the Split-Off of the Food Safety Division\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the split-off of the Food Safety Division business in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure. Management has determined that the Food Safety Division split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions (the split-off and certain internal business separation transactions referred to together as the ""Transactions"") qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, management applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed Transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the financial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s determination of the tax-free treatment of the Transactions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the information, including the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, U.S. federal tax law, other external tax advice, certain representations from management, and other relevant evidence used by management, as well as the application of relevant U.S. federal tax law to support management\'s determination that the Transactions qualify as tax-free.\n\n\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill Impairment Assessments for the Advanced Materials Division As described in Notes 1, 4, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\'s consolidated property, plant and equipment balance was $9.2 billion and goodwill balance was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the Advanced Materials Division makes up a portion of these balances. Management tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Management also tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. In December 2022, the Company committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to the impairment of long-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion) for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rate and other applicable items.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the appropriateness of management\'s discounted cash flow models and reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division, including controls over management\'s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment of an asset group or reporting unit has occurred and controls over the determination of the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\'s process for determining the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate. Evaluating management\'s assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, and capital expenditures involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the Advanced Materials Division, external market and industry data, evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the Company\'s objectives and strategies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 8, 2023 We have served as the Company\'s auditor since 1975.\n\n\n\n3M Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statement of Income Years ended December 31\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""(Millions, except per share amounts)"",2022,2021,2020\n1,Net sales,""$ 34,229"",""$ 35,355"",""$ 32,184""\n2,,,,\n3,Operating expenses,,,\n4,Cost of sales,""19,232"",""18,795"",""16,605""\n5,""Selling, general and administrative expenses"",""9,049"",""7,197"",""6,929""\n6,""Research, development and related expenses"",""1,862"",""1,994"",""1,878""\n7,Gain on business divestitures,""(2,724)"",-,(389)\n8,Goodwill impairment expense,271,-,-\n9,Total operating expenses,""27,690"",""27,986"",""25,023""\n10,Operating income,""6,539"",""7,369"",""7,161""\n11,,,,\n12,""Other expense (income), net"",147,165,366\n13,,,,\n14,Income before income taxes,""6,392"",""7,204"",""6,795""\n15,Provision for income taxes,612,""1,285"",""1,337""\n16,Income of consolidated group,""5,780"",""5,919"",""5,458""\n17,,,,\n18,""Income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes"",11,10,(5)\n19,Net income including noncontrolling interest,""5,791"",""5,929"",""5,453""\n20,,,,\n21,Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest,14,8,4\n22,,,,\n23,Net income attributable to 3M,""$ 5,777"",""$ 5,921"",""$ 5,449""\n24,,,,\n25,Weighted average 3M common shares outstanding -

Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term ""3M"" or ""Company"" refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 16.\nBasis of presentation: Certain amounts in the prior years\' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M\'s disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Exceptions include 3M\'s subsidiaries in Argentina and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, in Turkey, the economy of which also became highly inflationary. The operating income and balances of underlying net monetary assets denominated in Turkish lira are not material to 3M. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders\' equity.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nMarketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\' equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\nInvestments: All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\n\n\n\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance policies are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in ""Purchases of marketable securities and investments"" and ""Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,"" respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range ftwenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range offive to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $177 million and $176 millions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not ""more likely than not"" less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as ""Step 0"". 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.\nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from six to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset\'s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between twelve to nineteen years, patents largely between eight to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between six to ten years, definite lived tradenames largely betweeneleve and twenty years, and other intangibles largely ten years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Company\'s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within ""Research, development and related expenses.""\n\n\n\nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\'s or asset group\'s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees\' remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M\'s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company\'s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract\'s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M\'s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nThe Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.\nThe Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.\n\n\n\n3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:\nExemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less. Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration. ""Right to invoice"" practical expedient based on 3M\'s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3M\'s performance completed to date. Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes. Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of ASC 842,Leases. The Company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.\nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and totaled $323 million, $327 million and $278 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures.\nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software\'s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.\nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\'s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $115 million and $142 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740,Income Taxes.\n\n\n\nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company\'s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti- dilutive effect (30.3 million average options for 2022,7. million average options for 2021, and 18.1 million average options for 2020). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share follow:\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 89] NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n [source page: 89] NOTE 19.

Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and\n\n\n [source page: 38] Table of Contents\nsyncing of files across users\' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (""ETLAs""), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (""DDOM"") and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Creative ARR,Annual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value\n1,Document Cloud ARR,Annual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services + Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\n2,Digital Media ARR,Creative ARR + Document Cloud ARR\n }\n\nIn March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reported above.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Product\nCost of product revenue is primarily comprised of third-party royalties, localization costs and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.\n [source page: 43] Services and Other\nCost of services and other revenue is primarily comprised of compensation and contracted costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support, and hosting services and data center costs.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\n [source page: 61] Acquisitions:\n3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M's acquisition of these businesses.\n2022 acquisitions:\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2022. 2021 acquisitions: There were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021. 2020 acquisitions: There were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n [source page: 61] Divestitures:\n3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company's portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders. As discussed in Note 19 (Business Segments), gains/losses on business divestitures are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n2022 divestitures and previously announced divestitures:\nIn March 2022, 3M completed the sale of its floor products business in Western Europe, formerly part of the Consumer business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position ofl 9.9% in the business, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The Company expects to complete the transaction, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, by year-end 2023. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including final approval from the 3M Board of Directors, regulatory approvals and rulings, and satisfactory completion of financing, among other items. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\nIn September 2022, 3M completed the split-off and combination of its Food Safety Division business (formerly part of the Health Care business segment) with Neogen Corporation in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure intended to make the split-off tax-efficient to 3M and 3M's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the transaction, 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion based on aggregate consideration of $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the underlying agreements, aggregate consideration included 3M shares exchanged and $1.0 billion ($828 million after closing and other adjustments) funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. The cash and non-cash consideration components are further described below.\n$2.0 billion representing the value of 16 million 3M common shares accepted by 3M that reduced shares outstanding through a fully-subscribed exchange offer. The exchange ultimately resulted in subscribed 3M shareholders owning 50.1% of the common shares of Neogen. $828 million in cash and non-cash components funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. $478 million, net of divested cash, as a cash payment to 3M funded from Food Safety business borrowings coincident with the transaction that became obligations of Neogen. This amount is reflected in the investing section on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amount was subject to closing and other adjustments and included cash paid to 3M for direct sales of certain net assets of the Food Safety business to Neogen. $350 million as part of a non-cash debt-for-debt exchange that reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness and became new term-debt obligations of Neogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M determined that the split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, 3M applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Reverse Morris Trust split-off transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nNet sales information relative to the Food Safety Division is included in Note 2. Neogen and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition supply, manufacturing and services and into certain longer-term commercial supply and distributor arrangements.\n2021 divestitures:\nThere were no divestitures that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 120] Performance Shares\nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2022 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic sales growth, free cash flow growth, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 100% of the estimated number of shares at the end of three-year performance period and are reflected under ""Granted"" in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends; therefore, the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted earnings per share.\nThe following table summarizes performance share activity during the year ended December 31:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,,2022,,2021,,2020,\n1,(Shares in thousands),Number of Shares,Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value,Number of Shares,Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value,Number of Shares,Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\n2,Undistributed balance -,,,,,,\n3,As of January 1,481,$ 175.12,423,$ 188.61,444,$ 205.58\n4,Granted,269,144.77,166,176.79,203,153.16\n5,Distributed,(116),207.49,(115),228.80,(206),190.84\n6,Performance change,(196),153.15,40,176.35,25,166.49\n7,Forfeited,(47),155.71,(33),171.35,(43),172.92\n8,As of December 31,391,157.98,481,175.12,423,188.61\n }\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $7 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares.

Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 66] Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non- refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.\n\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 4] 3M COMPANY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 PART I\n [source page: 4] Item 1. Business.\n3M Company was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations begun in 1902. The Company\'s ticker symbol is MMM. As used herein, the term ""3M"" or ""Company"" includes 3M Company and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. In this document, for any references to Note 1 through Note 19, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n [source page: 4] Available Information\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that the Company files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company files annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).\n3M also makes available free of charge through its website (http://investors.3M.com) the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 49] Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\'s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.\nIn 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points.

Investing in 3M's businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs.

If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable content, particularly misleading content intended to manipulate public opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better serve our customers and expand our customer base. Our brands may be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate newsworthy content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion (e.g., ""DeepFakes""), by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our products and services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, illegal content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.

However, it is typically included in the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities.2. **Total Revenue for FY2015**:   - From the Consolidated Statements of Operations [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] [source page: 56], the Net revenue for 2015 is $3,991 million.Since the exact D&A amount is not provided in the excerpts, we cannot calculate the exact D&A percentage margin. The formula to calculate the D&A percentage margin, if the D&A amount were available, would be:\[ \text{D&A Percentage Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Depreciation and Amortization}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]**Conclusion**:To answer the query, the D&A percentage margin for AMD for FY2015 cannot be calculated with the provided information as the specific D&A amount from the cash flow statement is missing. Additional data from the detailed cash flow statement for 2015 is required to perform this calculation.","['<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 46] Tax-free Determination of the Split-Off of the Food Safety Division\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the split-off of the Food Safety Division business in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure. Management has determined that the Food Safety Division split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions (the split-off and certain internal business separation transactions referred to together as the ""Transactions"") qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, management applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed Transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the financial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s determination of the tax-free treatment of the Transactions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the information, including the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, U.S. federal tax law, other external tax advice, certain representations from management, and other relevant evidence used by management, as well as the application of relevant U.S. federal tax law to support management\'s determination that the Transactions qualify as tax-free.\n\n\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill Impairment Assessments for the Advanced Materials Division As described in Notes 1, 4, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\'s consolidated property, plant and equipment balance was $9.2 billion and goodwill balance was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the Advanced Materials Division makes up a portion of these balances. Management tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Management also tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. In December 2022, the Company committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to the impairment of long-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion) for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rate and other applicable items.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the appropriateness of management\'s discounted cash flow models and reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\'s property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division, including controls over management\'s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment of an asset group or reporting unit has occurred and controls over the determination of the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\'s process for determining the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\'s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate. Evaluating management\'s assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, and capital expenditures involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the Advanced Materials Division, external market and industry data, evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the Company\'s objectives and strategies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 8, 2023 We have served as the Company\'s auditor since 1975.\n\n\n\n3M Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statement of Income Years ended December 31\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,""(Millions, except per share amounts)"",2022,2021,2020\n1,Net sales,""$ 34,229"",""$ 35,355"",""$ 32,184""\n2,,,,\n3,Operating expenses,,,\n4,Cost of sales,""19,232"",""18,795"",""16,605""\n5,""Selling, general and administrative expenses"",""9,049"",""7,197"",""6,929""\n6,""Research, development and related expenses"",""1,862"",""1,994"",""1,878""\n7,Gain on business divestitures,""(2,724)"",-,(389)\n8,Goodwill impairment expense,271,-,-\n9,Total operating expenses,""27,690"",""27,986"",""25,023""\n10,Operating income,""6,539"",""7,369"",""7,161""\n11,,,,\n12,""Other expense (income), net"",147,165,366\n13,,,,\n14,Income before income taxes,""6,392"",""7,204"",""6,795""\n15,Provision for income taxes,612,""1,285"",""1,337""\n16,Income of consolidated group,""5,780"",""5,919"",""5,458""\n17,,,,\n18,""Income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes"",11,10,(5)\n19,Net income including noncontrolling interest,""5,791"",""5,929"",""5,453""\n20,,,,\n21,Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest,14,8,4\n22,,,,\n23,Net income attributable to 3M,""$ 5,777"",""$ 5,921"",""$ 5,449""\n24,,,,\n25,Weighted average 3M common shares outstanding -

Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term ""3M"" or ""Company"" refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 16.\nBasis of presentation: Certain amounts in the prior years\' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\'s chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M\'s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M\'s disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Exceptions include 3M\'s subsidiaries in Argentina and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, in Turkey, the economy of which also became highly inflationary. The operating income and balances of underlying net monetary assets denominated in Turkish lira are not material to 3M. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders\' equity.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nMarketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\' equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\nInvestments: All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\n\n\n\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance policies are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in ""Purchases of marketable securities and investments"" and ""Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,"" respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range ftwenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range offive to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $177 million and $176 millions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\'s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not ""more likely than not"" less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as ""Step 0"". 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.\nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from six to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset\'s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between twelve to nineteen years, patents largely between eight to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between six to ten years, definite lived tradenames largely betweeneleve and twenty years, and other intangibles largely ten years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Company\'s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within ""Research, development and related expenses.""\n\n\n\nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\'s or asset group\'s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\'s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees\' remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M\'s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company\'s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract\'s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M\'s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nThe Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.\nThe Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.\n\n\n\n3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:\nExemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less. Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration. ""Right to invoice"" practical expedient based on 3M\'s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3M\'s performance completed to date. Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes. Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of ASC 842,Leases. The Company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.\nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and totaled $323 million, $327 million and $278 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures.\nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software\'s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.\nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\'s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $115 million and $142 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740,Income Taxes.\n\n\n\nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company\'s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti- dilutive effect (30.3 million average options for 2022,7. million average options for 2021, and 18.1 million average options for 2020). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share follow:\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 92] Other Legal Matters\nThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business.

Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nU.S. Revolving Credit Facility\nOn May 18, 2021, we entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the ""Five Year Facility Agreement"") with a syndicate of banks. The Five Year Facility Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in May 2026. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five Year Facility Agreement as of January 28, 2023, or January 29, 2022.\nThe interest rate under the Five Year Facility Agreement is variable and is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\'s prime rate, (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate plus, in each case, 0.5%, and (3) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), subject to certain adjustments plus 1%, and (b) a variable margin rate (the ""ABR Margin""); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the ""LIBOR Margin""). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon our current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the Five Year Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.00% to 0.225%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.805% to 1.225%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.07% to 0.15% Additionally, the Five Year Facility Agreement includes fallback language related to the transition from LIBOR to alternative rates. The Five Year Facility Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\' abilities to incur liens on certain assets; make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of our business; dispose of material assets; engage in certain mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes; or engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\n\n\nThe Five Year Facility Agreement also contains covenants that require us to maintain a maximum cash flow leverage ratio. The Five Year Facility Agreement contains default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 37] Total debt:\nThe strength of 3M\'s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\'s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company\'s total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\'s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nAs disclosed in Note 12, 3M had debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: ADOBE_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 73] Cash Flow Hedges\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $2.43 billion and $2.06 billion, respectively, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, Indian Rupees, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.\nIn June 2019, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedged the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange option contracts expected to be recognized within the next 18 months, of which $53 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the next 12 months. In addition, we had net derivative losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts, of which $7 million of losses are expected to be recognized into operating expenses within the next 12 months, and net derivative losses on our Treasury lock agreements, of which $5 million is expected to be recognized into interest expense within the next 12 months.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest expense, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same income statement line item as the hedged item. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively, and on an ongoing basis both retrospectively and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\nFor fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 49] All Other\nAll Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $452 million of acquisition-related costs, which primarily include transaction costs, amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step- up adjustment, and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation charges related to the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, and licensing gain.

The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable decreased operating cash flow by $623 million in 2022, compared to an operating cash flow decrease of $507 million in 2021. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the ""Financial Condition and Liquidity"" section. The 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) largely impacted the 2022 net income component above, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements. The 2022 non-cash impairment expenses added back to net income in arriving at net cash provided by operating activities above primarily relate to 3M\'s commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Note 15.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,""Year ended December 31, (Millions)"",2022,2021\n1,""Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)"",""$ (1,749)"",""$ (1,603)""\n2,Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets,200,51\n3,""Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net"",11,204\n4,""Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold"",13,-\n5,""Cash payment from Food Safety business split-off, net of divested cash"",478,-\n6,Other - net,1,31\n7,Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,""$ (1,046)"",""$ (1,317)""\n }\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures (including the cash payment from the Food Safety business split-off). The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.

Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and also by lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013.

Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 47] International Sales\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 75% in 2015, 81% in 2014 and 85% in 2013. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in China. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.\n [source page: 47] FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 26, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $785 million were lower compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and the timing of related collections and the timing of accounts payable payments made. During 2015, we used $96 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 26, 2015 and 89% as of December 27, 2014.\n\n\nOur debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $2.3 billion as compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014. During 2015, we received $100 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with the savings from our restructuring plans and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.\nOver the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 46] Interest Expense\nInterest expense of $160 million in 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to $177 million in 2014, primarily due to timing of issuances of new debt and repurchases of other debt in 2014.\nInterest expense of $177 million in 2014 was flat compared to $177 million in 2013.\n [source page: 46] Other Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, in 2015 was $5 million compared to $66 million of other expense, net, in 2014 and $0 million of other expense, net, in 2013.\nIn 2015, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn 2014, we recognized $66 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million interest income.\nIn 2013, we recognized $0 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $2 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $2 million realized loss on sale of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments, offset by $5 million interest income.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 94] Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

BUSINESS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including ""believes,"" ""expects,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""seeks,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""pro forma,"" ""estimates,"" ""anticipates,"" or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: demand for AMD\'s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; future restructuring activities; the nature and extent of AMD\'s future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) and the materiality of these payments; the materiality of AMD\'s future purchases from GF; sales patterns of AMD \'s semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products; AMD\'s expected completion of its restructuring plan announced in October 2015 (the 2015 Restructuring Plan) and the anticipated cash payments and savings from the 2015 Restructuring Plan; statements regarding the proposed joint ventures (the JVs) between AMD and Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, Co., Ltd., including the JVs\' expected future performance (including expected results of operations and financial guidance); benefits from the proposed JVs; the JVs\' future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; statements about regulatory and other approvals; the closing date for the proposed transaction; AMD\'s expected future filing of patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions; AMD\'s expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; the expected completion of AMD\'s exit from its dense server business; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; that AMD does not expect to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; that other unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change in the next 12 months; that AMD\'s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, the savings from its restructuring plans and the secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) will be sufficient to fund AMD\'s operations including capital expenditures over the next 12 months; AMD\'s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; its dependence on a small number of customers for a substantial part of its revenue; its hedging strategy; its expenditures related to environmental compliance and conflict minerals disclosure requirements; and AMD does not expect to pay dividends in the future. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation\'s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD \'s ability to compete effectively; AMD relies on GF to manufacture all of its microprocessor and APU products and a certain portion of its GPU products, with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD\'s manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD\'s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD\'s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD\'s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD\'s business and operating results; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD\'s notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; the completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, its transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect it; the markets in which AMD\'s products are sold are highly competitive; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD\'s products could materially adversely affect it; AMD\'s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; the demand for AMD\'s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD\'s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation\'s support for its products or other software vend\n\n\nors do not design and develop software to run on AMD\'s products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; AMD\'s reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks; AMD\'s inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder its product development programs; in the event of a change of control, AMD may not be able to repurchase its outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit; the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect its business in the future; acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of its common stock; AMD\'s business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt its business, processes and internal controls; data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMD\'s intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business and reputation; AMD\'s operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture its products, AMD could be materially adversely affected; if AMD: products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, it could be materially adversely affected; costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on AMD; if AMD fails to maintain the efficiency of its supply chain as it responds to changes in customer demand for its products, its business could be materially adversely affected; AMD outsources to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of its product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services; AMD may incur future impairments of goodwill; AMD\'s worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for AMD\'s products; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect AMD; AMD \'s inability to effectively control the sales of its products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on it; if AMD cannot adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, it may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses; AMD may not be able to successfully monetize its intellectual property; AMD is a party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products; AMD\'s business is subject to potential tax liabilities; a variety of environmental laws that AMD is subject to could result in additional costs and liabilities; and higher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect AMD \'s business.\nFor a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, see ""Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors"" and the ""Financial Condition"" section set forth in ""Part II, Item 7-Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, beginning on page 35 below and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth below in this report or detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports and filings.

The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in total cash payments of $14 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016. We expect actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016.\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in ""Other current liabilities"" and ""Other long-term liabilities"" on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,Severance and related benefits,Other exit related costs,Total\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,""Balance as of June 27, 2015"",$ -,$ -,$ -\n3,""Charges (reversals), net"",27,10,37\n4,Cash payments,(13),(1),(14)\n5,Non-cash charges,-,(9),(9)\n6,""Balance as of December 26, 2015"",$ 14,$ -,$ 14\n }\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 54] Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,Year Ended,\n1,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n2,,(In,""millions, except per share"",amounts)\n3,Net revenue,""$ 23,601"",""$ 16,434"",""$ 9,763""\n4,Cost of sales,""11,550"",""8,505"",""5,416""\n5,Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles,""1,448"",-,-\n6,Total cost of sales,""12,998"",""8,505"",""5,416""\n7,Gross profit,""10,603"",""7,929"",""4,347""\n8,,,,\n9,Research and development,""5,005"",""2,845"",""1,983""\n10,""Marketing, general and administrative"",""2,336"",""1,448"",995\n11,Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles,""2,100"",-,-\n12,Licensing gain,(102),(12),-\n13,Operating income,""1,264"",""3,648"",""1,369""\n14,,,,\n15,Interest expense,(88),(34),(47)\n16,""Other income (expense), net"",8,55,(47)\n17,Income before income taxes and equity income,""1,184"",""3,669"",""1,275""\n18,,,,\n19,Income tax provision (benefit),(122),513,""(1,210)""\n20,Equity income in investee,14,6,5\n21,Net income,""$ 1,320"",""$ 3,162"",""$ 2,490""\n22,,,,\n23,Earnings per share,,,\n24,Basic,$ 0.85,$ 2.61,$ 2.10\n25,Diluted,$ 0.84,$ 2.57,$ 2.06\n26,Shares used in per share calculation,,,\n27,Basic,""1,561"",""1,213"",""1,184""\n28,Diluted,""1,571"",""1,229"",""1,207""\n }\n\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 69] NOTE 6: Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Computing and Graphics,""Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom"",All Other,Total\n1,,,(In,millions),\n2,Initial goodwill due to ATI acquisition,""$ 1,194"",$ 255,$ 745,""$ 2,194""\n3,Initial goodwill due to SeaMicro acquisition,165,65,-,230\n4,,""1,359"",320,745,""2,424""\n5,Accumulated impairment losses,""(1,126)"",-,(745),""(1,871)""\n6,""Balance as of December 28, 2013"",233,320,-,553\n7,Impairment charges,(233),-,-,(233)\n8,""Balance as of December 27, 2014"",-,320,-,320\n9,Assets held-for-sale,-,(42),-,(42)\n10,""Balance as of December 26, 2015"",-,278,-,278\n11,Accumulated impairment losses,""$ (1,359)"",$ -,$ (745),""$ (2,104)""\n }\n\nAs a result of the decision to form the JVs with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015 reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which requires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets included goodwill of $42 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, the Company\'s realignment of its organizational structure, effective July 1, 2014, caused a change in the composition of the Company\'s reportable segments and reporting units. This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Company\'s reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during the third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Company\'s estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the Company\'s reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting unit\'s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill. In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the reporting units to its carrying value. The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair value, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step of the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any unrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the present value of future cash flows based on management\'s forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment exceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in ""Goodwill impairment charge"" on the Company\'s consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to these reporting units. In connection with completing the goodwill\n\n\nimpairment analysis, the Company reviewed its long-lived tangible and intangible assets within the Computing and Graphics reporting unit under ASC 360, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."" The Company determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess of their carrying values, and therefore these assets were not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill. Based on the results of the Company\'s analysis of goodwill, each reporting unit\'s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment in 2015 and 2013.\nAcquisition-related intangible assets\nAs a part of the Company\'s strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company decided to exit the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in ""Restructuring and other special charges, net"" on the Company\'s consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property.\nThe balances of acquisition-related intangible assets as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n0,,,,""December 26, 2015"",,,,""December 27, 2014"",\n1,,Gross,Impairment charges,Accumulated Amortization,Net,Weighted-average amortization period,Gross,Accumulated Amortization,Net\n2,,,,,""(In millions,"",except years),,,\n3,Developed technology,$ 258,$ (54),$ (204),$ -,5.15 years,$ 258,$ (201),$ 57\n4,In-process research and development,6,(6),-,-,N/A,6,-,6\n5,Customer relationships,168,(1),(167),-,1.25 years,168,(167),1\n6,Trademark and trade name,37,(1),(36),-,1.25 years,37,(36),1\n7,Total,$ 469,$ (62),$ (407),$ -,4.56 years,$ 469,$ (404),$ 65\n }\n\nThe following table summarizes amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2015,2014,2013\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Developed technology,$ 3,$ 13,$ 13\n3,Customer relationships,-,1,1\n4,Trademark and trade name,-,-,4\n5,Total,$ 3,$ 14,$ 18\n }\n\nNOTE 7: Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 are summarized below:\n\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,Total Fair Value,Cash and Cash Equivalents\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,""December 26, 2015"",,\n3,Cash,$ 409,$ 409\n4,Level 2(2),,\n5,Commercial paper,376,376\n6,Total level 2,376,376\n7,Total,$ 785,$ 785\n }\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,Total Fair Value,Cash and Cash Equivalents,Short-Term Marketable Securities\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,""December 27, 2014"",,,\n3,Cash,$ 391,$ 391,$ -\n4,Level 1(1)(2),,,\n5,Money market funds,4,4,-\n6,Total level 1,4,4,-\n7,Level 2²(3),,,\n8,Commercial paper,618,410,208\n9,Corporate bonds,27,-,27\n10,Total level 2,645,410,235\n11,Total,""$ 1,040"",$ 805,$ 235\n }\n\n(1) The Company\'s Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. (2) The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during 2015 and 2014. (3) The Company\'s Level 2 short-term investments are valued using broker reports that utilize quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments. Brokers gather observable inputs for all of the Company\'s fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers and other third-party sources.\n\n\n\nAvailable-for-sale securities held by the Company as of December 26, 2015 consisted of commercial paper and as of December 27, 2014 also consisted of money market funds and corporate bonds. The amortized cost of available-for-sale securities approximates the fair value for all periods presented.\nIn addition to those amounts presented above, as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had approximately $1 million and $10 million, respectively, of available-for-sale investments in money market funds, used as collateral for leased buildings and letters of credit deposits, which were included in Other assets on the Company\'s consolidated balance sheets. These money market funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized costs are the same as the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these deposits.\nAlso in addition to those amounts presented above, at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had approximately $15 million and $16 million, respectively, of available-for-sale investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Company\'s deferred compensation plan, which were also included in ""Other assets"" on the Company\'s consolidated balance sheets. These mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its debt. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are as follows:\n\n\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,December,""26, 2015"",December,""27, 2014""\n1,,Carrying Amount,Estimated Fair Value,Carrying Amount,Estimated Fair Value\n2,,,(In,millions),\n3,Short-term debt (excluding capital leases),$ 230,$ 230,$ 172,$ 173\n4,Long-term debt (excluding capital leases),""$ 2,025"",""$ 1,372"",""$ 2,025"",""$ 1,858""\n }\n\nThe Company\'s short-term and long-term debt are classified within Level 2.

The fair value of the Company\'s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing payment terms.\nHedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 61] Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013\n [source page: 61] NOTE 1: Nature of Operations\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company primarily offers:\n(i) x86 microprocessors, as a standalone central processing unit (CPU) or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer, commercial and professional graphics markets; and (ii) server and embedded CPUs, GPUs and APUs, and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.\n\n\n [source page: 61] NOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\'s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances and future price reductions, based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors, are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Company sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor agreements, which may be cancelled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Company\'s products that the Company has removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is sold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with agreements that have the aforementioned terms until the merchandise is resold by the distributors and reports such deferred amounts as ""Deferred income on shipments to distributors"" on its consolidated balance sheet. Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the Company\'s various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Company\'s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The Company records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances based on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Company\'s product cost. Deferred income on shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, latest published prices and latest product costs.\nThe Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing promotions and volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\'s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.\n\n\nDeferred revenue and related product costs were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 26, 2015"",""December 27, 2014""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Deferred revenue,$ 94,$ 130\n3,Deferred cost of sales,(41),(58)\n4,Deferred income on shipments to distributors,$ 53,$ 72\n }\n\nInventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two- step process. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nCommitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Company\'s earnings in the period the changes are made. (See Notes 15 and 16).\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Company\'s policies and practices and negotiated settlements.\nCash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nInvestments in Certain Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available- for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders\' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\nThe Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company\'s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into\n\n\nconsideration all of the Company\'s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying its strategy, the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.\nThe Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: equipment, two to six years; buildings and building improvements, up to 40 years; and leasehold improvements, measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\nAssets Held for Sale. Assets held for sale represents components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company\'s financial statements at lower of carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The determination of fair value involves significant judgments and assumptions. In determining the fair value less cost to sell, the Company considered factors including, among others, the nature of the sales transaction, the composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, current sales prices for comparable assets and/or businesses and negotiations with third party purchaser(s).\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company\'s assets held for sale included in other current assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale included in other current liabilities amounted to $183 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 4 ""Equity Interest Purchase Agreement"" below, for additional information.\nProduct Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company\'s approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end users for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as ""processors in a box"" and for certain server CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of ""tray"" microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who have written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of sale of warranted products.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of all of the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\nForeign Subsidies. The Company received investment grants in connection with the construction and operation of certain facilities in Asia. Generally, such grants are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other conditions specified in the relevant grant documents. Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded, a current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nThe Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.\nMarketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $154 million, $194 million and $210 million, respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash\n\n\npaid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued by the Company to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in connection with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) transaction in 2009. On March 7, 2014, the Company issued 34,906,166 shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise in full by WCH of its warrant to purchase up to 35,000,000 shares of the Company\'s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, the warrant is no longer outstanding. The issuance of the common stock did not have any effect on basic and dilutive earnings per share amounts because the full 35,000,000 shares of common stock issuable to WCH had already been included in the denominator for calculating basic and dilutive earnings per share for all periods presented.\nDiluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted loss per share:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2015,2014,2013\n1,,(In,""millions, except per share amounts)"",\n2,Numerator-Net loss:,,,\n3,Numerator for basic and diluted net loss per share,$ (660),$ (403),$ (83)\n4,Denominator-Weighted-average shares:,,,\n5,Denominator for basic and diluted net loss per share,783,768,754\n6,Net loss per share:,,,\n7,Basic,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11)\n8,Diluted,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11)\n }\n\nPotential shares from outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units totaling approximately 52 million, 48 million and 59 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were not included in the net loss per share calculations as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company\'s available-for-sale securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive loss.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,,,""December 26, 2015"",,,""December 27, 2014"",\n1,,Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities,Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges,Total,Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities,Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges,Total\n2,,,,(In millions),,,\n3,Beginning balance,$ 1,$ (6),$ (5),$ 1,$ (3),$ (2)\n4,""Unrealized gains (losses) arising during the period, net of tax effects"",(2),(22),(24),-,(9),(9)\n5,""Reclassification adjustment for (gains) losses realized and included in net loss, net of tax effects"",-,21,21,-,6,6\n6,Total other comprehensive income (loss),(2),(1),(3),-,(3),(3)\n7,Ending balance,$ (1),$ (7),$ (8),$ 1,$ (6),$ (5)\n }\n\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\'s fair-value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock and restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\'s common\n\n\nstock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that involve a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nThe application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility of the Company\'s common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future.\nForfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the Company\'s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIncome Tax. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 will be effective in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial statements.\nInventory. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 will be effective in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.\nInterest-Imputation of Interest. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016, at which time the Company will reclassify approximately $30 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company\'s long-term debt from other non- current assets to long-term debt. A reclassification will also be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented.\nDisclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\'s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), which provides guidance on management\'s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company\'s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 will be effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.\nShare-Based Payments with Performance Targets. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which requires that a performance target be treated as a performance condition if it affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period is rendered. ASU 2014-12 will be effective in the first quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company may use either of two methods: (i) prospective application to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (ii) retrospective application to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter, with the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-12 as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements. The Company evaluated the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-12 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined which method it will apply. The adoption of this standard will not materially impact the Company\'s consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates. ASU 2014-09 also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and estimates used. In July 2015, FASB announced a decision to defer the effective date for this ASU. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first\n\n\nquarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted (for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The Company may adopt ASU 2014-09 either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined which approach it will apply.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2015_10K] \n  [source page: 34] Five Years Ended December 26, 2015 (In millions except per share amounts)\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5\n0,,2015(1),2014(1),2013(1),2012(1),2011(1)\n1,Net revenue,""$ 3,991"",""$ 5,506"",""$ 5,299"",""$ 5,422"",""$ 6,568""\n2,Income (loss) from continuing operations (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7),(660),(403),(83),""(1,183)"",495\n3,""Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(8)"",-,-,-,-,(4)\n4,Net income (loss) attributable to AMD common stockholders,$ (660),$ (403),$ (83),""$ (1,183)"",$ 491\n5,Net income (loss) attributable to AMD common stockholders per common share,,,,,\n6,Basic,,,,,\n7,Continuing operations,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11),$ (1.60),$ 0.68\n8,Discontinued operations,-,-,-,-,(0.01)\n9,Basic net income (loss) attributable to AMD common stockholders per common share,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11),$ (1.60),$ 0.68\n10,Diluted,,,,,\n11,Continuing operations,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11),$ (1.60),$ 0.67\n12,Discontinued operations,-,-,-,-,(0.01)\n13,Diluted net income (loss) attributable to AMD common stockholders per common share,$ (0.84),$ (0.53),$ (0.11),$ (1.60),$ 0.66\n14,Shares used in per share calculation,,,,,\n15,Basic,783,768,754,741,727\n16,Diluted,783,768,754,741,742\n17,Long-term debt and other long term liabilities,""$ 2,118"",""$ 2,140"",""$ 2,175"",""$ 2,065"",""$ 1,590""\n18,Total assets,""$ 3,109"",""$ 3,767"",""$ 4,337"",""$ 4,000"",""$ 4,954""\n }\n\n(1) 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 consisted of 52 weeks, whereas 2011 consisted of 53 weeks. (2) In 2013, we entered into licenses and settlements regarding patent-related matters. Pursuant to these licenses and settlements, we received in aggregate, $48 million, net, which we recorded within net legal settlements in 2013. (3) During 2011, we changed the method of accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. As a result of the change, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $492 million, net of certain transaction related charges. In 2011, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $209 million related to our investment in GF. (4) During the first quarter of 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA with GF. The primary effect of this amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. As a result of the amendment, we recorded a $703 million charge during the first quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our production wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million, which resulted in a $273 million lower of cost or market charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. (5) In 2015, 2014, 2012 and 2011, we implemented restructuring plans and incurred net charges of $53 million, $58 million, $6 million, $100 million and $100 million in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which primarily consisted of severance and related employee benefits. (6) In 2015, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro resulting to a charge of $76 million in restructuring and other special charges, net. In 2014, we incurred other special charges of $13 million primarily related to the departure of our former CEO. In 2013, we sold and leased back buildings in various locations and land in Austin, Texas, for which we recorded a net charge of $24 million in other special charges. (7) In 2014, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million related to our Computing and Graphics segment. Also in 2014, we recorded a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment related to our second generation APU products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8) In 2008, we sold our Digital Television business to Broadcom Corporation for $141.5 million and classified it as discontinued operations. In 2011, we recorded a charge of $4 million in connection with a payment to Broadcom related to this asset sale. (9) Total long-term debt and other long term liabilities increased by $110 million from 2012 to 2013, primarily due to obligations associated with the license of $157 million of new technology and software, partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes). Total long-term debt and other long term liabilities increased by $475 million from 2011 to 2012, primarily due to an issuance of $500 million principal amount of our 7.50% Notes.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 43] Introduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, ""us,"" ""our"" or ""AMD""), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in ""Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\n [source page: 43] Overview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry\'s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.\n\n\n\nWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm VersalTM ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership AI inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct™ ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm TM 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.\nIn the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen TM Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, loT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria TM KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision and industrial communication and control.\nFor the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new ""Zen 4"" architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with up to 16 ""Zen 4"" architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on ""Zen 3+"" architecture and includes AMD RDNATM 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing ""Zen 3"" architecture to premium Chrome os devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper TM PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on ""Zen 3"" core architecture.\nIn the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNATM 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.\nAlthough the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 67] Revenue\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) include amounts received from customers and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods for development services, IP licensing and product revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one year was $247 million, of which $213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less.\nRevenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 18% of the Company\'s revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n [source page: 67] NOTE 4 - Segment Reporting\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management\'s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company\'s disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company\'s CODM assesses the company\'s financial performance and allocates resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.\nThe Company\'s four reportable segments are:\nthe Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers; the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers; the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain.\n\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nYear Ended\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,Year Ended,\n1,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n2,,,(In millions),\n3,Net revenue:,,,\n4,Data Center,""$ 6,043"",""$ 3,694"",""$ 1,685""\n5,Client,""6,201"",""6,887"",""5,189""\n6,Gaming,""6,805"",""5,607"",""2,746""\n7,Embedded,""4,552"",246,143\n8,Total net revenue,""$ 23,601"",""$ 16,434"",""$ 9,763""\n9,Operating income (loss):,,,\n10,Data Center,""$ 1,848"",$ 991,$ 198\n11,Client,""1,190"",""2,088"",""1,608""\n12,Gaming,953,934,(138)\n13,Embedded,""2,252"",44,(11)\n14,All Other,""(4,979)"",(409),(288)\n15,Total operating income (loss),""$ 1,264"",""$ 3,648"",""$ 1,369""\n }\n\nThe following table provides items included in All Other category:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,Year Ended,\n1,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n2,,,(In millions),\n3,Operating loss:,,,\n4,Stock-based compensation expense,""$ 1,081"",$ 379,$ 274\n5,Acquisition-related costs,452,42,14\n6,Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles,""3,548"",-,-\n7,Licensing gain,(102),(12),-\n8,Total operating loss,""$ 4,979"",$ 409,$ 288\n }\n\nThe Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.\nThe following table summarizes sales to external customers by geographic regions based on billing location of the customer:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,Year Ended,\n1,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n2,,,(In millions),\n3,United States,""$ 8,049"",""$ 4,656"",""$ 2,294""\n4,China (including Hong Kong),""5,207"",""4,096"",""2,329""\n5,Japan,""4,177"",""2,381"",""1,033""\n6,Europe,""1,773"",""1,249"",""1,108""\n7,Taiwan,""2,369"",""2,091"",""1,187""\n8,Singapore,""1,380"",""1,389"",""1,096""\n9,Other countries,646,572,716\n10,Total sales to external customers,""$ 23,601"",""$ 16,434"",""$ 9,763""\n }\n\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes sales to major customers that accounted for at least 10% of the Company\'s consolidated net revenue for the respective years:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,,Year Ended,\n1,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n2,Customer A,16 %,14%,\n3,Customer B,*,11%,\n }\n\nLess than 10%\nSales to customers A and B consisted of sales of products from the Gaming and Client segments, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes Property and equipment, net by geographic areas:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,United States,""$ 1,102"",$ 486\n3,Canada,80,105\n4,China,42,35\n5,Singapore,132,35\n6,India,67,11\n7,Ireland,48,-\n8,Other countries,42,30\n9,""Total property and equipment, net"",""$ 1,513"",$ 702\n }\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 51] Operating Activities\nOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products, a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 31] Year 2022 results:\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in automotive and aerospace, commercial solutions and advanced materials, and decreased in transportation safety and electronics. Growth was held back by weaker consumer electronics end-market demand and ongoing impacts of semiconductor supply chain constraints on automotive markets.\n\n\nDivestitures:\nDivestiture impact relates to lost Transportation and Electronics sales year-on-year from deconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in July 2022.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to special item charges for PFAS manufacturing exit costs related to asset impairments (discussed in Note 15) resulting in a 2022 fourth quarter pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion. Margins were also impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and investments in auto electrification, partially offset by selling price actions, strong spending discipline and restructuring actions. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufacturing exit costs (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\nYear 2021 results:\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were up 10.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in advanced materials, commercial solutions, automotive and aerospace, electronics and transportation safety. Growth benefited from improving automotive-end market activity such as increases in car and light truck builds, strong demand in data center, semiconductor, interconnect and consumer electronics markets and increased advertising spend and return to workplace trends partially offset by impacts from semiconductor supply chain constraints.\n\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage, benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges, and COVID impacts recognized on certain assets in 2020 that were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMD_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 4] Overview\nWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:\nserver microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers; CPUs, accelerated processing units (APUs) that integrate CPUs and GPUs, and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers; discrete GPUs, and semi-custom SoC products and development services; and embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, we may also sell or license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\n\n\n [source page: 5] Additional Information\nAMD was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on May 1, 1969 and became a publicly held company in 1972.

Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at- home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.\nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment.

These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer\'s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, we must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on management\'s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management\'s best judgment of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We adjust the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome.\nWe are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations.

The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax benefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.\n\n\n\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of FDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers\' compensation.\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Deferred tax assets:,,\n3,Net operating loss carryovers,""$ 1,031"",$ 920\n4,Accruals and reserves not currently deductible,835,631\n5,Employee benefits not currently deductible,214,164\n6,Federal and state tax credit carryovers,631,319\n7,Foreign R&D and investment tax credits,578,547\n8,Capitalized costs,65,121\n9,Lease liability,161,124\n10,Capitalized R&D,943,-\n11,Other,85,27\n12,Total deferred tax assets,""4,543"",""2,853""\n13,Less: valuation allowance,""(2,078)"",""(1,735)""\n14,""Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance"",""2,465"",""1,118""\n15,Deferred tax liabilities:,,\n16,Acquired intangibles,""(3,430)"",(50)\n17,Right-of-use assets,(151),(110)\n18,Undistributed foreign earnings,(35),(24)\n19,GILTI,(633),-\n20,Other,(92),(15)\n21,Total deferred tax liabilities,""(4,341)"",(199)\n22,Net deferred tax assets (liabilities),""$ (1,876)"",$ 919\n }\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability.\nAdditionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts resulted in increased current year taxable income, but which are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.\n\n\n\nThe movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576"",""$ 2,867""\n3,Charges (reductions) to income tax expense and other accounts*,112,3,""(1,301)""\n4,Acquisition-related,231,-,-\n5,Net recoveries,-,156,10\n6,Balance at end of year,""$ 2,078"",""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576""\n }\n\n* Amounts recorded in 2020 reflect release of valuation allowances. + The net recoveries for all were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits.\nUnder current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nThe Company\'s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were $435 million and $476 million, respectively. Net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2023 and 2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company\'s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company\'s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between 2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $595 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040.\nThe Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx\'s cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of the Company\'s gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,$ 275,$ 119,$ 65\n3,Increases for tax positions taken in the current year,748,156,30\n4,Increases for tax positions taken in prior years,104,14,41\n5,Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years,(12),(9),(15)\n6,Increases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions,252,-,-\n7,Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses,(6),(5),(2)\n8,Balance at end of year,""$ 1,361"",$ 275,$ 119\n }\n\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $1.2 billion, $215 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company\'s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including $12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billion and $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS.\nIt is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 49] INCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6 percent and 24.6 percent for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current year related to the resolution of prior-year tax items. The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.\n\n\n\n [source page: 50] TABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5\n0,""Years Ended December 31,"",2022,2021,2020,Change 2022 VS. 2021,Change 2021 VS. 2020\n1,Network volumes (billions),""$ 1,552.8"",""$ 1,284.2"",""$ 1,037.8"",21 %,24%\n2,Billed business,""$ 1,338.3"",""$ 1,089.8"",$ 870.7,23,25\n3,Processed volumes,$ 214.5,$ 194.4,$ 167.1,10,16\n4,Cards-in-force (millions),133.3,121.7,112.0,10,9\n5,Proprietary cards-in-force,76.7,71.4,68.9,7,4\n6,Basic cards-in-force (millions),111.5,100.7,91.3,11,10\n7,Proprietary basic cards-in-force,59.1,54.7,52.7,8,4\n8,Average proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars),""$ 23,496"",""$ 20,392"",""$ 16,352"",15,25\n9,Average discount rate,2.34%,2.30%,2.28%,,\n10,Average fee per card (dollars)(a),$ 82,$ 74,$ 67,11 %,10 %\n }\n\n(a) Average fee per card is computed on an annualized basis based on proprietary Net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 73] Reconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2022,2021,2020\n1,Statutory U.S. tax rate,21.0 %,21.0 %,21.0 %\n2,Food Safety divestiture,(8.4),-,-\n3,State income taxes - net of federal benefit,-,0.9,1.2\n4,International income taxes - net,(0.4),(1.2),(1.2)\n5,Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI),0.7,0.7,0.8\n6,Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII),(2.3),(3.1),(1.8)\n7,U.S. research and development credit,(1.0),(0.7),(1.0)\n8,Reserves for tax contingencies,-,0.6,0.5\n9,Employee share-based payments,(0.2),(0.6),(0.5)\n10,All other net,0.2,0.2,0.7\n11,Effective worldwide tax rate,9.6%,17.8 %,19.7 %\n }\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factor that decreased the effective tax rate for 2022 was the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on the split-off of the Food Safety business. The primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2021 in comparison to 2020 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) involved a transition tax that is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $380 million and $508 million, respectively, in long term income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $126 million and $68 million, respectively, payable within one year associated with the transition tax.\nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns through 2018, but the years 2005 through 2017 have not closed as the Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions where the Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments, which could be impacted by evolving political environments in those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company's tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M's unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.

The actual amount of any changes could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any assessments, resolutions or law changes. An estimate of the amount or range of such changes cannot be made at this time.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 187] ARTICLE 11 AMENDMENT & TERMINATION\n46\n46\n46\n [source page: 187] ARTICLE 12 GENERAL PROVISIONS\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n [source page: 188] ARTICLE 1 HISTORY AND EFFECTIVE DATES\n [source page: 188] Section 1.1 History.\n(a) On November 26, 1973, the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of American Express Company (""Amex"") authorized and approved the adoption of the American Express Supplementary Pension Plan (the ""Plan"") to supplement retirement benefits provided under the American Express Retirement Plan and other retirement and savings plans sponsored by Amex for a select group of management or highly compensated individuals. (b) On July 1, 1994, the Board authorized and directed the amendment and restatement of the Plan pursuant to the provisions of Section VII thereof. The Plan was amended and restated generally effective March 1, 1995, and renamed the American Express Company Supplemental Retirement Plan. The Plan was subsequently amended through December 31, 2004. (c) On July 25, 2005, the Board amended and restated the Plan (immediately prior to such amendment and restatement, the ""Prior SRP Plan""), effective January 1, 2005. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Participants who were in ""pay status"" as of January 1, 2005 continue to have the payment of their Supplemental Benefits governed solely by the terms of the Prior SRP Plan; provided, however, that effective with payments made in calendar year 2006 and thereafter, payments other than monthly annuity payments which would have been made on April 1 of any year under the Prior SRP Plan are made on July 1 of such year. Participants who were not in ""pay status"" as of January 1, 2005 are governed from and after such date by the terms of the Plan, as amended and restated, and as further amended and restated from time to time. For purposes of this section, a Participant was in ""pay status"" as of January 1, 2005 if he or she was entitled to benefits under the Plan as of January 1, 2005, with payments scheduled to begin on or before April 1, 2005. (d) Effective as of October 1, 2005, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (""AFI"") ceased to be a participating employer in Amex\'s tax-qualified retirement plans and the components of such plans covering AFI participants were transferred to new plans established by AFI in a transaction that complied with Section 414(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). In connection with that transaction, the component of the Prior SRP Plan and the Plan covering AFI participants were similarly transferred, and active and retired AFI participants and AFI beneficiaries ceased participation in and no longer have any benefits under the Prior SRP Plan or the Plan. (e) Generally effective July 1, 2007, benefit accruals under the American Express Retirement Plan, as amended (the ""RP""), were ceased. In addition, generally effective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas of July 1, 2007, Amex adopted certain changes to the American Express Incentive Savings Plan, as amended, and renamed such plan the American Express Retirement Savings Plan (the ""RSP"").\n(f) On January 22, 2007, the Board amended and restated the Plan, generally effective July 1, 2007, to reflect the changes made to the RP and the RSP, to allow for the elective deferral of compensation under the Plan, and to rename the Plan the American Express Supplemental Retirement Plan.

Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See ""Dividends and Share Repurchases"" below.\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.\nWe seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company\'s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries.\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.\n\n\n\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022:\nTABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,Effective Minimum (a),""Ratios as of December 31, 2022""\n1,Risk-Based Capital,,\n2,Common Equity Tier 1,7.0%,\n3,American Express Company,,10.3 %\n4,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n5,Tier 1,8.5,\n6,American Express Company,,11.1\n7,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n8,Total,10.5,\n9,American Express Company,,12.8\n10,American Express National Bank,,13.2\n11,Tier 1 Leverage,4.0%,\n12,American Express Company,,9.9\n13,American Express National Bank,,9.7%\n }\n\n(a) Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for AENB.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders\' equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below.\n\n\n\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information on our preferred shares.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio - Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to ""Capital and Liquidity Regulation"" under Part 1, Item 1. ""Business - Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.\nAs a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve\'s supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 69] LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $42.6 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.

RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as ""Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks,"" ""Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks"" and ""Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks."" You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the ""Risk Management"" section under ""MD&A,"" which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\n [source page: 25] Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, and demand for fee-based products and services.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, household income and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine), public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, interest rates, taxes, inflation and deflation (including the effects of related governmental responses), energy costs, availability of capital and credit and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Recently, levels of inflation have been significantly elevated. Sustained periods of high inflation may, among other things, increase certain of our expenses and erode consumer purchasing power, confidence and spending. An economic downturn or recession may result in higher unemployment and lower household income, consumer spending, corporate earnings and business investment, which may negatively impact spending on our cards and demand for our products, and increase delinquencies and write-off rates.\nTravel and entertainment (T&E) expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, for example, are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small business and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 45 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies, unemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact customer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation or unavailability of systems or technology by cyberattacks), operational incidents, and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, including actions aimed at upending geopolitical stability, fiscal and monetary policies (including developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling), trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on travel and mobility and health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel protection products we offer.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had, and continues to have, widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and consumer and business spending. The pandemic and resulting containment measures adversely impacted a significant portion of our network volumes. The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of factors, including the emergence of new variants, impacts to the labor market, supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the impacts of the pandemic may continue even as the pandemic subsides. The extent to which our business and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the lingering impacts of the pandemic will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, including the continued spread and severity of the virus and new variants; the imposition or concern relating to the possible imposition of further containment measures; the availability, distribution, use and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact on consumers and businesses as forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to operational changes and staffing issues; and the extent of the continued resumption of normal operating conditions and customer behaviors.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we suspended all business operations in Russia and Belarus and this conflict has led to economic uncertainty and market disruptions, including heightened energy prices, and the imposition of financial and economic sanctions and export controls designed to constrain Russia. The broader consequences of this conflict remain uncertain, but may include further sanctions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, increased prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, potential retaliatory action by customers or the Russian government against companies such as us, heightened regulatory scrutiny related to sanctions compliance, increased inflation, further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, decreases in global travel, further disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of certain natural resources and other adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions.\nHurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and the impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather- related events. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of U.S. consumer and small business billed business and Card Member loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on purchase volume. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks) and perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. Government actions or initiatives may also provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages and may create new competitors, including in some cases a government entity. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending and borrowing habits as effectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we evolve our value propositions, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers, such as point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions.\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data and demand for our products and services may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights and by certain regulations, such as open banking initiatives, which may result in disintermediating existing financial services providers, steering customers away from our products and services or decreasing our attractiveness to partners.\nTo the extent we expand into, or further grow in, new business areas and new geographic regions, such as mainland China, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions.\n\n\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See ""Partners and Relationships"" under ""Business"" for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ""Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"" for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as\n\n\n\ncobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cyber security incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our network volumes, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or ""flown."" If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. At December 31, 2022, our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchases that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $31.1 billion. This amount assumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such purchases or to accept such chargebacks, and that all such billed business results in claims-in-full by Card Members. Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the current global economic, financial and geopolitical conditions. See Note 12 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information regarding this exposure.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see ""Risk Management-Institutional Credit Risk-Exposure to the Airline and Travel Industry"" under ""MD&A.""\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 85] OTHER MATTERS\nAs previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. We completed our review of this matter in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in an immaterial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n [source page: 85] RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to the Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements.""\n [source page: 85] GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\nAdjusted net interest income - A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans.\nAirline-related volume - Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&E-related volume.\nAsset securitizations - Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate - This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under ""Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity"" for further related definitions under Basel III.\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member\'s payment due date.\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out- of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member\'s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 159] PART III\nITEMS 10, 11, 12 and 13.

In addition, the Tax Act imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to U.S. income tax, which is payable over a period of eight years. In response to the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued a Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") that provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts while the accounting impact of the Tax Act was still under analysis, not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act.\nIn fiscal 2018, we recorded provisional tax expense of $283 million related to the Tax Act. The $283 million included a $209 million charge associated with the deemed repatriation tax and a $74 million charge primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate. During fiscal 2019 we finalized our calculations under SAB 118 and recorded a $20 million reduction in the deemed repatriation tax and a $3 million reduction in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIncome tax expense decreased to $424 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $818 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the $283 million of tax expense associated with the Tax Act recorded in the prior year and the lower U.S. statutory tax rate in the current year, partially offset by the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year. Our effective income tax rate (""ETR"") for fiscal 2019 was 22.4%, compared to a rate of 45.0% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act recorded in the prior year and the lower U.S. statutory tax rate in the current year, partially offset by the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year.\nIncome tax expense increased to $818 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $609 million in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the $283 million of tax expense associated with the Tax Act, partially offset by the impacts from the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the lower blended U.S. statutory tax rate of 33.7% and a higher mix of pre-tax income from foreign operations in fiscal 2018. Our ETR for fiscal 2018 was 45.0%, compared to a rate of 33.5% in fiscal 2017. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a higher mix of pre-tax income from foreign operations in fiscal 2018.\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 102] Discount Revenue\nDiscount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid- sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our network partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 84] 11.

Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, broadened the base to which U.S. income tax applies, imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to U.S. income tax and changed how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. income tax.\nIn response to the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") which provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts to the extent they were reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information became available, not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, our blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 33.7% for fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 of $283 million The $283 million included a $209 million charge associated with the deemed repatriation tax and a $74 million charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new 21.0% tax rate.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 236] DEFERRAL ACCOUNT SCHEDULE RATE\nUnder the Interest Method, the Schedule Rate used to determine the earnings credited on a Participant\'s Deferral Accounts for such calendar year shall be determined under the following metric, based on Amex\'s ""ROE"" for such calendar year and its ""ROE Target Range"" for such calendar year:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Amex\'s ROE,Schedule Rate\n1,Below ROE Target Range,Moody\'s A Rate\n2,Within ROE Target Range,9%\n3,Above ROE Target Range,11%\n }\n\nAmounts credited under this Schedule are subject to any caps imposed by Article 7 of the Plan, including the limitation of amounts credited to an Executive Officer to an amount which will not exceed the AFR when required by Section 7.3.\nAmex\'s ""ROE"" for a calendar year means Amex\'s consolidated annual return on equity for such calendar year, as reported by Amex, subject to adjustment for significant accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.\nAmex\'s ""ROE Target Range"" for a calendar year means the ROE target range announced by Amex and in effect on January 1st of such calendar year.\nExcept as otherwise provided by Section 9.2(b)(ii) of the Plan, the Schedule Rate under this Schedule A for any calendar year may be changed by the Committee, prospectively or retrospectively, in its sole discretion, without prior notice to or consent of Participants or Beneficiaries.\n\n\nSCHEDULE B RESERVED\n\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 85] Reconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,2018,2017,2016\n1,Statutory U.S. tax rate,21.0 %,35.0 %,35.0 %\n2,State income taxes net of federal benefit,1.0,0.8,0.9\n3,International income taxes net,0.2,(6.3),(2.7)\n4,Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI),1.1,-,-\n5,Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII),(1.3),-,-\n6,U.S. TCJA enactment net impacts,2.5,10.1,-\n7,U.S. research and development credit,(1.5),(0.7),(0.5)\n8,Reserves for tax contingencies,1.2,2.2,0.2\n9,Domestic Manufacturer's deduction,-,(1.8),(1.8)\n10,Employee share-based payments,(1.4),(3.2),(2.8)\n11,All other net,0.6,(0.6),-\n12,Effective worldwide tax rate,23.4 %,35.5 %,28.3 %\n }\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points, impacted by several factors. Primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate included favorable aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the decrease in the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, and favorable adjustment to prior year uncertain tax provisions. These decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points, impacted by several factors. Primary factors that increased the Company's effective tax rate included the impacts due to the TCJA being enacted in 2017 (see further information below) and remeasurements and establishment of 3M's uncertain tax positions. The increase was partially offset by actions which related to international taxes that were impacted by increasing benefits from the Company's supply chain centers of expertise, changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and prior year cash optimization actions, higher year-on-year excess tax benefit for employee share-based payment, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, a reduction of state taxes, and other items.\nThe TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of up to one year from the TCJA's enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as follows:\nTransition tax: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company recorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA. The TCJA's transition\n\n\n\ntax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with the transition tax.\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax expense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts. During 2018, 3M recorded an additional net tax expense of $79 million as an associated measurement period adjustment.\n3M has recorded current tax on GILTI relative to 2018 operations and will continue to account for GILTI as a period cost when incurred.\nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 to 2014, and 2016, but the years have not closed as the Company is in the process of resolving open issues. The Company remains under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2015, 2017 and 2018. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company's tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:\nFederal, State and Foreign Tax\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,(Millions),2018,2017,2016\n1,Gross UTB Balance at January 1,$ 530,$ 319,$ 381\n2,,,,\n3,Additions based on tax positions related to the current year,129,119,67\n4,Additions for tax positions of prior years,146,149,43\n5,Reductions for tax positions of prior years,(123),(38),(66)\n6,Settlements,(17),(3),(95)\n7,Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations,(18),(16),(11)\n8,,,,\n9,Gross UTB Balance at December 31,$ 647,$ 530,$ 319\n10,,,,\n11,Net UTB impacting the effective tax rate at December 31,$ 655,$ 526,$ 333\n }\n\nThe total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $655 million as of December 31, 2018, $526 million as of December 31, 2017, and $333 million as of December 31, 2016. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $12 million of expense, $20 million of expense, and $10 million of expense in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $69 million and $68 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\n\n\n\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Thailand (2018), China (2019), Korea (2019), Switzerland (2023), Singapore (2025), and Brazil (2028). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $227 million (38 cents per diluted share) in 2018, $228 million (37 cents per diluted share) in 2017, and $142 million (23 cents per diluted share) in 2016.\nThe Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $12 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\n""]",7.482499599456787,1.737767219543457,5.352217674255371,4.310344934463501,25388,225,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below.\nOn February 25, 2020, we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, captioned Laurelwood Cleaners LLC V. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction in California prohibiting American Express from enforcing its anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions and from requiring merchants ""to offer the service of Amex-card acceptance for free."" The case has been stayed pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings.\nOn January 29, 2019, we were named in a putative class action brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Anthony Oliver, et al. V. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc., in which the plaintiffs are holders of MasterCard, Visa and/or Discover credit cards (but not American Express cards) and allege they paid higher prices as a result of our anti-steering and non- discrimination provisions in violation of federal antitrust law and the antitrust and consumer laws of various states. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other forms of relief. The court dismissed plaintiffs\' federal antitrust claim, numerous state antitrust and consumer protection claims and their unjust enrichment claim. The remaining claims in plaintiffs\' complaint arise under the antitrust laws of 11 states and the consumer protection laws of six states.\nOn March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam\'s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam\'s Market, et al. V. Visa Inc., et al., for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California\'s Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On August 28, 2020, the court granted plaintiffs\' motion for class certification.\nIn July 2004, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation V. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Mawarid Investments Limited filed a request for confidential arbitration under the 1998 London Court of International Arbitration Rules in connection with certain claims arising under a shareholders agreement between Mawarid and TRS relating to a joint venture between the parties, Amex (Middle East) BSC(c) (AEME). In 2008, the tribunal rendered a partial award, including a direction that an audit should take place to verify whether acquirer discount revenue related to transactions occurring with airlines located in the Middle East region had been properly allocated to AEME since its inception in 1992. In September 2021, the tribunal rendered a further partial award regarding the location of transactions through non-physical channels. In May 2022, the tribunal further clarified the 2021 partial award and the discount rate that should apply to transactions through non-physical channels. A final award is now expected in 2023.\nIn May 2020, we began responding to a review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney\'s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Protection Bureau (CFPB) pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January 2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against us at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against us seeking fines or other remedial actions. We are cooperating with all inquiries.\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting.\nOur legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages sought, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss.\nWe have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable.\nFor those disclosed legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $200 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters.

The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax benefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.\n\n\n\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of FDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers\' compensation.\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Deferred tax assets:,,\n3,Net operating loss carryovers,""$ 1,031"",$ 920\n4,Accruals and reserves not currently deductible,835,631\n5,Employee benefits not currently deductible,214,164\n6,Federal and state tax credit carryovers,631,319\n7,Foreign R&D and investment tax credits,578,547\n8,Capitalized costs,65,121\n9,Lease liability,161,124\n10,Capitalized R&D,943,-\n11,Other,85,27\n12,Total deferred tax assets,""4,543"",""2,853""\n13,Less: valuation allowance,""(2,078)"",""(1,735)""\n14,""Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance"",""2,465"",""1,118""\n15,Deferred tax liabilities:,,\n16,Acquired intangibles,""(3,430)"",(50)\n17,Right-of-use assets,(151),(110)\n18,Undistributed foreign earnings,(35),(24)\n19,GILTI,(633),-\n20,Other,(92),(15)\n21,Total deferred tax liabilities,""(4,341)"",(199)\n22,Net deferred tax assets (liabilities),""$ (1,876)"",$ 919\n }\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability.\nAdditionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts resulted in increased current year taxable income, but which are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.\n\n\n\nThe movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576"",""$ 2,867""\n3,Charges (reductions) to income tax expense and other accounts*,112,3,""(1,301)""\n4,Acquisition-related,231,-,-\n5,Net recoveries,-,156,10\n6,Balance at end of year,""$ 2,078"",""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576""\n }\n\n* Amounts recorded in 2020 reflect release of valuation allowances. + The net recoveries for all were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits.\nUnder current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nThe Company\'s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were $435 million and $476 million, respectively. Net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2023 and 2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company\'s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company\'s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between 2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $595 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040.\nThe Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx\'s cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of the Company\'s gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,$ 275,$ 119,$ 65\n3,Increases for tax positions taken in the current year,748,156,30\n4,Increases for tax positions taken in prior years,104,14,41\n5,Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years,(12),(9),(15)\n6,Increases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions,252,-,-\n7,Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses,(6),(5),(2)\n8,Balance at end of year,""$ 1,361"",$ 275,$ 119\n }\n\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $1.2 billion, $215 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company\'s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including $12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billion and $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS.\nIt is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 112] Product Liability Litigation\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms - Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless, as discussed below, face litigation from approximately 232,000 claimants. As noted in the ""Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies"" section above, in July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters and those described in the earlier section ""Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies"". 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M has committed $1.0 billion to fund this trust and has committed an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities. Related to these actions, which represent a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M. Upon the filings in late July 2022 in the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, all litigation against Aearo Entities that filed chapter 11 cases is automatically stayed.\nThe Aearo Entities have also requested that the Bankruptcy Court confirm that Combat Arms Earplugs litigation against the Company is also stayed or order it enjoined. In August 2022, the Bankruptcy Court denied Aearo\'s motion for a preliminary injunction to stay all Combat Arms related litigation against 3M. In September 2022, the bankruptcy judge certified Aearo\'s request to appeal the decision directly to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and in October the Seventh Circuit accepted the appeal. In December 2022, Aearo filed its opening brief with the Seventh Circuit appealing the bankruptcy court\'s decision. Also in December 2022, the parties to the Aearo bankruptcy agreed to extend the exclusivity period for Aearo to file a plan for reorganization to March 31, 2023. Confidential mediation is underway with court-appointed mediators and settlement discussions between Aearo and the plaintiffs are ongoing. As noted in the co-mediators\' report issued on January 20, 2023, 3M continues to support Aearo Entities by engaging in confidential mediation discussions toward a resolution of the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation in the chapter 11 process. In February 2023, the plaintiffs filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy filings of Aearo Entities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 3M\'s consolidated balance sheet reflected amounts associated with the deconsolidated Aearo Entities as follows:\n$0.7 billion asset balance in equity and other investments (within other assets), reflecting 3M\'s equity investment interest in the entities. $0.6 billion net liability for former intercompany amounts due from 3M to the deconsolidated entities. The gross balances are reflected in other liabilities (6.9 billion) and other assets ($0.3 billion). $1.2 billion accrued liability related to the commitments describe above, largely reflected within contingent liability claims and other (within other liabilities) on 3M\'s consolidated balance sheet.\n\n\n\nPreceding Combat Arms Earplugs matters:\nIn December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M\'s Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs - Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages.\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits (including 14 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 141,000 individual claimants making similar allegations. The significant increase from year-end 2021 in the number of claimants is largely due to the number of claims moved from the administrative docket to the active docket as the result of the transition orders the multi-district litigation (MDL) judge began issuing at the end of 2021 (as more fully described below), in addition to claims filed directly on the active docket in 2022. In April 2019, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs\' summary judgment motion and denied the defendants\' summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs\' claims are not barred by the government contractor defense. The court denied the Company\'s request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs\' motion to consolidate three plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021.\nIn April 2021, 3M received an adverse jury verdict in the first bellwether trial. The jury awarded thethree plaintiffs less than $1 million in compensatory damages and $6 million in punitive damages for a total of $7 million. 3M appealed the verdicts, challenging, among other rulings, the MDL court\'s denial of 3M\'s motion to assert the government contractor defense. The next two bellwether trials occurred in May and June of 2021. In May 2021, 3M received a verdict in its favor in the second bellwether trial, in which a jury rejected claims that 3M knowingly sold earplugs with design defects. In June 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the third bellwether trial. The jury found 3M liable for strict liability failure to warn, but found 3M not liable for design defect or fraud. The jury apportioned fault 62 percent to 3M and 38 percent to the plaintiff for a total damage award of approximately $1 million. 3M appealed the verdict. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for the appeals of the first and third bellwether trials for the week of May 1, 2023. In October 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the fourth bellwether trial, in which a jury awarded $8 million to the plaintiff. 3M received verdicts in its favor in the fifth and sixth bellwether trials. 3M received an adverse verdict in the seventh and eighth bellwether trials, in which the juries awarded the plaintiffs $13 million and $23 million, respectively. A post-trial order reduced the award in the seventh bellwether trial to $8 million. 3M prevailed in the ninth and tenth bellwether cases but received adverse verdicts in the eleventh bellwether case in which the jury awarded each of thetwo plaintiffs $15 million in compensatory and $40 million in punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory and punitive damages award toone of the plaintiffs from $55 million to $22 million. 3M received adverse verdicts in the twelfth and thirteenth bellwether cases in which the jury awardedone plaintiff with $50 million and another with $8 million in compensatory damages. 3M prevailed in the fourteenth bellwether trial. Plaintiff in the fourteenth bellwether trial has filed a notice of appeal. In December 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her Eleventh Circuit appeal of a jury verdict in favor of 3M and Aearo. No other cases that resulted in a defense verdict are on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit at this time. In April 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff\'s verdict in the fifteenth bellwether trial, awarding $2.2 million in compensatory damages and declining to award punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory damages award to $1.2 million. In May 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff\'s verdict in the last scheduled federal bellwether trial. The jury awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $72 million in punitive damages. These trials have not included several bellwether cases that plaintiffs\' counsel dismissed with prejudice either during discovery or after being set for trial. The Company\'s appeals to the Eleventh Circuit from the adverse verdicts are proceeding forward, with oral argument on the first two appeals scheduled for May 2023. Other than the Company\'s funding commitment for its Aearo subsidiaries\' chapter 11 proceedings as described above, no liability has been recorded for the Combat Arms earplugs litigation because the Company believes any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. Following conclusion of the bellwether trial process and unsuccessful settlement discussions, and with another 2,000 cases being prepared for trial while the Company\'s appeals are still pending, the Aearo Entities and the Company adopted a change in strategy for managing these alleged litigation liabilities that led to the Aearo Entities initiating the chapter 11 proceedings as discussed above. An administrative docket of approximately 90,700 unfiled and unverified claims has also been maintained at the MDL court. The MDL court in August 2021 provided notice of an intent to issue forthcoming transition orders requiring all claims be moved off the administrative docket to the active docket on a rolling basis over 12 months. The orders will provide that any case not moved to the active docket will be dismissed without prejudice, and the administrative docket will then be closed. The MDL court also ordered the parties to prepare for trial 2,000 cases in four waves of 500 cases over the next 14 months. After the preparation of these cases is completed, the cases will be remanded to the federal district courts where the cases were originally filed. In October 2022, the MDL court ordered that while the successor liability issue described below is on appeal, all wave discovery would be stayed, the transition of cases from the administrative docket to the active docket would stop, and that monthly settlement conferences involving all parties (except Aearo) would occur in the MDL. In January 2023, the MDL judge ordered that the MDL mediation would stop while the bankruptcy court mediation is ongoing.\n\n\n\nThe court ordered a three-day mediation in July 2022; and again in September 2022, a two-day mediation session. The court also set the date for a single plaintiff trial for October 2022, which was postponed to February 2023, and then stayed. In August 2022, subsequent to Aearo\'s chapter 11 filing, the MDL court issued an order prohibiting 3M from attempting to relitigate issues in the bankruptcy court and from financially supporting any collateral dispute regarding the MDL court\'s previous rulings. 3M has appealed the order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and made a motion to stay the order pending appeal. In October 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted 3M\'s motion to stay the order pending appeal. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit scheduled oral argument for this appeal for the week of May 1, 2023.\nIn September 2022, two MDL plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking to permanently enjoin 3M from transferring assets, issuing dividends or completing the announced spin-off of its Health Care business, to allegedly preserve assets for the Combat Arms claimants. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and an opposition to the injunction motion. In December 2022, the court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Also in December 2022, the MDL court granted plaintiffs\' motion for summary judgment that successor liability, claiming that 3M is fully and independently liable for injuries allegedly caused by the CAEv2 and certified the order for appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. In January 2023, 3M sought the Eleventh Circuit\'s acceptance of the appeal. 3M is also defending lawsuits brought primarily by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal court, and the federal court remanded them to state court in March 2020. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in October 2021 that the cases brought by non-military plaintiffs were properly remanded to state court, whereas the cases brought by military contractor plaintiffs who had received the Combat Arms Earplugs from the military should have remained in federal court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit granted 3M\'s unopposed motion to vacate the remand orders in the remaining appeals of military service member cases. The military service member cases are expected to be remanded to federal court and transferred to the MDL. There are approximately 40 lawsuits involving approximately 1,000 plaintiffs pending in the state court. The state court cases are subject to a bellwether case selection process. The first trial in Hennepin County was scheduled for October 2022, but has been postponed to July 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was a named defendant in approximately5,258 lawsuits in the United States and one Canadian putative class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the Bair HuggerTM patient warming system caused a surgical site infection.\nAs previously disclosed, 3M is a named defendant in lawsuits in federal courts involving 5,000 plaintiffs alleging that they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger patient warming system. The plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.\nThe U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs\' causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. A panel of the appellate court in August 2021 reversed the district court\'s exclusion of the plaintiffs\' causation experts and the grant of summary judgment for 3M. The Company sought further appellate en banc review by the full Eighth Circuit court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit court denied 3M\'s petition for rehearing en banc. In February 2022, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. In May 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court declined 3M\'s request to review the Eighth Circuit court\'s decision. The MDL court has not yet issued a new case management order.\nIn February 2022, the MDL court ordered the parties to engage in any mediation sessions that a court-appointed mediator deems appropriate. Mediation sessions took place in May and August 2022 without success in resolving the litigation. Separately, in August 2021, the Eighth Circuit court affirmed the 2018 jury verdict in 3M\'s favor in the only bellwether trial in the MDL.\nIn addition to the federal cases, there are five state court cases. Three are pending in Missouri state court and combine Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. One of the Missouri cases was tried in September and October of 2022; the jury returned a verdict in 3M\'s favor on all the claims. Another Missouri case is scheduled for trial in 2024. There is also one case in Etowah County, Alabama that combines Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. 3M resolved for an immaterial amount the final state court case, which was filed in Hidalgo County, Texas.\n\n\n\nAs previously disclosed, 3M had been named a defendant in 61 cases in Minnesota state court. In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded plaintiffs\' experts and granted 3M\'s motion for summary judgment on general causation. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied plaintiffs\' petition for review and entered the final dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases.\nIn June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims were due to the use of the Bair HuggerTM patient warming system.

Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See ""Dividends and Share Repurchases"" below.\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.\nWe seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company\'s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries.\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.\n\n\n\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022:\nTABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,Effective Minimum (a),""Ratios as of December 31, 2022""\n1,Risk-Based Capital,,\n2,Common Equity Tier 1,7.0%,\n3,American Express Company,,10.3 %\n4,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n5,Tier 1,8.5,\n6,American Express Company,,11.1\n7,American Express National Bank,,11.3\n8,Total,10.5,\n9,American Express Company,,12.8\n10,American Express National Bank,,13.2\n11,Tier 1 Leverage,4.0%,\n12,American Express Company,,9.9\n13,American Express National Bank,,9.7%\n }\n\n(a) Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for AENB.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders\' equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below.\n\n\n\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information on our preferred shares.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio - Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio - Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to ""Capital and Liquidity Regulation"" under Part 1, Item 1. ""Business - Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.\nAs a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve\'s supervisory stress tests in 2022.

The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.\nThe Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts' economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. Our ownership of variable interests in the Lending Trust was $16.0 billion and $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and in the Charge Trust was $5.2 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts.\nThe debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8).\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust was $59 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and by the Charge Trust was nil and $1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.\nUnder the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities.

Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo\'s respirator business (American OpticalCorporation,Warner-LambertLLC,AOCorp.andCabotCorporation (""Cabot"")) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. In July 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (collectively, the ""Aearo Entities"") voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation (including the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters). This represents a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. As a result, 3M\'s accrual relative to the commitments associated with that trust includes Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has stayed the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters as the chapter 11 proceedings move forward. For additional information, see the discussion within the section ""Product Liability Litigation"" with respect to Aearo Technologies Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\n\n\nPreceding respirator mask/asbestos - Aearo Technologies matters/information:\nPrior to the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings and as previously disclosed, as of December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $46 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the ""Payor Group""). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the ""AO Safety"" brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo\'s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, SO long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo\'s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\'s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo\'s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\'s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo\'s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 85] OTHER MATTERS\nAs previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate - This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under ""Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity"" for further related definitions under Basel III.\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member\'s payment due date.\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out- of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member\'s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 69] LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $42.6 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities.

Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for obligations arising out of local Card Members\' spending outside\n\n\n\nsuch country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members\' currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB\'s capital levels. The FDIA\'s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately $4.6 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\n\n\n\nITEM 1B.

We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources.

The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $102.8 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 5] Card Issuing Businesses\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses are conducted through our USCS, CS and ICS reportable operating segments.

We acquire and retain high- spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by:\nDesigning innovative products and features that appeal to our target customer base and meet their spending and borrowing needs Using incentives to drive spending on our various card products and increase customer engagement, including our Membership Rewards program, cash-back reward features, interest rates offered on deposits and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners Providing digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as airport lounge access, dining experiences and other travel and lifestyle benefits Creating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care Developing a wide range of partner relationships, including with other corporations and institutions that sponsor certain of our cards under cobrand arrangements and provide benefits and services to our Card Members\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last several years, we have focused on broadening the appeal of our products to attract new customers, particularly Millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our position with small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. We have also introduced new adjacent products that complement our existing products, such as our business checking and consumer rewards checking account products and new digital capabilities, which in part result from our acquisitions of Kabbage, Resy and acompay. Additionally, we have evolved our card issuing businesses by bringing together our consumer, SME and large commercial issuing activities outside of the United States into a new ICS organization to enable a greater focus on local priorities. Jurisdictions that represent a significant portion of our billed business outside of the United States include the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), Australia, Japan, Canada and Mexico.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,338 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 76.7 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 258] CERTIFICATION\nI, Jeffrey C.

Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers and aggregators are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants on our behalf. As merchants become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing a merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our network volumes, ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\nOur average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and network and loan volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases and, as a result of a litigation settlement, surcharging of credit card purchases is permitted by merchants in certain jurisdictions in Canada. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n\n\n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, which could become more prevalent with the existence of debit cards on the American Express network. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in- force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and\n\n\n\nmaintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\nWe publicly share certain information about our ESG initiatives. We may face increased scrutiny related to these activities from governments, regulators, the media, investors, colleagues, customers and other stakeholders, including from parties that oppose ESG initiatives. Responding to ESG considerations and the implementation of our ESG goals and initiatives involves risk and uncertainties, requires investments and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our ESG goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results. Our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, if at all, could impact our reputation, colleague retention and public perceptions of our business.\nA major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services.\nWe and third parties collect, process, transfer, host, store, analyze, retain, provide access to and dispose of account information, payment transaction information, and certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues in connection with our cards and other products and in the normal course of our business.\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. These threats can arise from external parties, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems and supply chains, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. Cyber threats, including attacks from state sponsored or nation-state actors, can increase during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card Member, travel and loyalty program data, colleague information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties. We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change, new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. In addition, we maintain cyber crisis response procedures and regularly test our procedures to remain prepared and reduce the risk of harm to our business operations, customers and third parties in the event of an information or cyber security incident.\nDespite our efforts and the efforts of third parties that process, transmit or store our data and data of our customers and colleagues or support our operations, such as service providers, merchants and regulators, the possibility of information, operational and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is\n\n\n\ndeployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices and communications platforms that are outside of our network and control environments. For example, we are aware that certain of our third-party vendors have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances affecting our data or the services they provide to us. In addition, new products and services, such as checking accounts and non-card lending, may lead to an increase in the number or types of cyber attacks and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information). An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. Our ability to address incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies.\nInformation, operational or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediation costs), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems and those of our third parties upon which we rely, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience service disruptions or degradation, which may result from technology malfunction, sudden increases in processing or other volumes, natural disasters and weather events, fires, accidents, technology change management issues, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and other cyberattacks, inadequate infrastructure in lesser- developed markets, technology capacity management issues, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or electronic break- ins, or similar events. Service disruptions or degradations can prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, impede or prevent transaction processing and financial reporting, disrupt ordinary business operations, result in contractual penalties or obligations, trigger regulatory reporting obligations, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight, and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cyber security and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch vendors or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that was not authorized or diminishes the value of our closed loop.\n\n\n\nThe management and oversight of multiple third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over third parties, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers' service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, in certain cases there may be limited alternatives or high costs for diversification, and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to the service providers of our third-party providers.\n"", ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 154] Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology.

The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax benefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.\n\n\n\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of FDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers\' compensation.\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021""\n1,,(In,millions)\n2,Deferred tax assets:,,\n3,Net operating loss carryovers,""$ 1,031"",$ 920\n4,Accruals and reserves not currently deductible,835,631\n5,Employee benefits not currently deductible,214,164\n6,Federal and state tax credit carryovers,631,319\n7,Foreign R&D and investment tax credits,578,547\n8,Capitalized costs,65,121\n9,Lease liability,161,124\n10,Capitalized R&D,943,-\n11,Other,85,27\n12,Total deferred tax assets,""4,543"",""2,853""\n13,Less: valuation allowance,""(2,078)"",""(1,735)""\n14,""Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance"",""2,465"",""1,118""\n15,Deferred tax liabilities:,,\n16,Acquired intangibles,""(3,430)"",(50)\n17,Right-of-use assets,(151),(110)\n18,Undistributed foreign earnings,(35),(24)\n19,GILTI,(633),-\n20,Other,(92),(15)\n21,Total deferred tax liabilities,""(4,341)"",(199)\n22,Net deferred tax assets (liabilities),""$ (1,876)"",$ 919\n }\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability.\nAdditionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts resulted in increased current year taxable income, but which are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.\n\n\n\nThe movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576"",""$ 2,867""\n3,Charges (reductions) to income tax expense and other accounts*,112,3,""(1,301)""\n4,Acquisition-related,231,-,-\n5,Net recoveries,-,156,10\n6,Balance at end of year,""$ 2,078"",""$ 1,735"",""$ 1,576""\n }\n\n* Amounts recorded in 2020 reflect release of valuation allowances. + The net recoveries for all were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits.\nUnder current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nThe Company\'s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were $435 million and $476 million, respectively. Net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2023 and 2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company\'s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company\'s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between 2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $595 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040.\nThe Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx\'s cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of the Company\'s gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""December 31, 2022"",""December 25, 2021"",""December 26, 2020""\n1,,,(In millions),\n2,Balance at beginning of year,$ 275,$ 119,$ 65\n3,Increases for tax positions taken in the current year,748,156,30\n4,Increases for tax positions taken in prior years,104,14,41\n5,Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years,(12),(9),(15)\n6,Increases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions,252,-,-\n7,Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses,(6),(5),(2)\n8,Balance at end of year,""$ 1,361"",$ 275,$ 119\n }\n\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $1.2 billion, $215 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company\'s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including $12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billion and $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS.\nIt is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain.

We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers\' everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (""Current Health"") and Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (""Yardbird""). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks.\nSegment Information\nOur business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business) and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada). Our chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable segment.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within SG&A.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""January 28, 2023"",""January 29, 2022"",""January 30, 2021""\n1,Cash and cash equivalents,""$ 1,874"",""$ 2,936"",""$ 5,494""\n2,Restricted cash included in Other current assets,379,269,131\n3,""Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"",""$ 2,253"",""$ 3,205"",""$ 5,625""\n }\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in restricted cash are primarily restricted to use for product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 30] Restricted Cash\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $379 million and $269 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively.

Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at- home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.\nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment.

Additionally, the Company\'s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody\'s Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company\'s total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following ""Cash Flows from Financing Activities"" section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\'s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its ""well-known seasoned issuer"" (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\'s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\'s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nAs disclosed in Note 12, 3M had debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\n\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 25] Segment Performance Summary\nDomestic Segment\nSelected financial data for the Domestic segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Domestic Segment Performance Summary,2023,2022,2021\n1,Revenue,""$ 42,794"",""$ 47,830"",""$ 43,293""\n2,Revenue % change,(10.5)%,10.5%,7.9\n3,Comparable sales % change(1),(10.3)%,11.0%,9.2 %\n4,Gross profit,""$ 9,106"",""$ 10,702"",""$ 9,720""\n5,Gross profit as a % of revenue,21.3%,22.4 %,22.5 %\n6,SG&A,""$ 7,332"",""$ 7,946"",""$ 7,239""\n7,SG&A as a % of revenue,17.1%,16.6%,16.7 %\n8,Restructuring charges,$ 140,$ (39),$ 133\n9,Operating income,""$ 1,634"",""$ 2,795"",""$ 2,348""\n10,Operating income as a % of revenue,3.8%,5.8%,5.4 %\n11,Selected Online Revenue Data,,,\n12,Total online revenue,""$ 14,212"",""$ 16,430"",""$ 18,674""\n13,Online revenue as a % of total segment revenue,33.2%,34.4%,43.1 %\n14,Comparable online sales% change (1),(13.5)%,(12.0)%,144.4\n }\n\n(1) Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.\nThe decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories, particularly computing, home theater, mobile phones and appliances.

Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances. Entertainment: The 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software. Services: The 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering that includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and higher supply chain costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure.

The weighted-average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which includes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of sales on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of inventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis.

(7) Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019.

As such, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base, and an International segment (comprised of Canada and Mexico) comparable sales metric for the full year was not provided.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 22] Best Buy Stock Comparative Performance Graph\nThe information contained in this Best Buy Stock Comparative Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be ""soliciting material"" or ""filed"" or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index (""S&P 500""), of which we are a component, and the Standard & Poor\'s Retailing Group Industry Index (""S&P Retailing Group""), of which we are also a component.

Therefore, we can conclude that Best Buy's gross margins have been historically consistent as per the provided data.Gross margins are a relevant metric for a company like Best Buy, which operates in the retail sector. This metric is crucial as it indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold, essentially reflecting the efficiency with which a company manages its production costs and pricing strategies.

In fiscal 2024, we currently expect to close approximately 20 to 30 Best Buy stores and to increase the number of Outlet Centers to approximately 30.\nDomestic segment revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Revenue Mix,Summary,Comparable Sales,Summary\n1,,2023,2022,2023,2022\n2,Computing and Mobile Phones,43°,44%,(12.0)%,5.1\n3,Consumer Electronics,30 %,31 %,(12.2)%,15.9 %\n4,Appliances,15%,14%,(5.7)%,24.1\n5,Entertainment,6%,6%,(5.5)%,7.4 %\n6,Services,5%,5%,(2.5)%,5.9%\n7,Other,1%,-%,1.6%,N/A\n8,Total,100 %,100 %,(10.3)%,11.0 %\n }\n\nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 12.0% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones, wearables and tablets. Consumer Electronics: The 12.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, digital imaging and headphones. Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances. Entertainment: The 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software. Services: The 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering that includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and higher supply chain costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure.

Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at- home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.\nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment.

We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers\' everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (""Current Health"") and Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (""Yardbird""). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks.\nSegment Information\nOur business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business) and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada). Our chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable segment.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within SG&A.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,,""January 28, 2023"",""January 29, 2022"",""January 30, 2021""\n1,Cash and cash equivalents,""$ 1,874"",""$ 2,936"",""$ 5,494""\n2,Restricted cash included in Other current assets,379,269,131\n3,""Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"",""$ 2,253"",""$ 3,205"",""$ 5,625""\n }\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in restricted cash are primarily restricted to use for product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities.\n\n\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 23] Overview\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life.

We use a combination of discounted cash flow (""DCF"") models and market data, such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. DCF models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.\n [source page: 32] Effects if actual results differ from assumptions\nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Compared to fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy\'s market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote.\nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. In fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more significantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue growth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the more uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher than for our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 246] CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-8 (Nos. 333-30689, 333-30691, 333-44760, 333-73192, 333-101727, 333-109282, 333-128251, 333-130150, 333-151039, 333-156626, 333-156627, 333-166908, 333-181269, 333- 181270, and 333-211431) and Form S-3 (Nos. 333-236344, 333-42660, and 333-109211) of 3M Company of our report dated February 8, 2023 relating to the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this Form 10-K.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 8, 2023\n\n\n\n [source page: 247] POWER OF ATTORNEY\nEach of the undersigned Directors and the Principal Executive, Principal Financial and Principal Accounting Officers of 3M COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), hereby constitute and appoint Michael F.

In addition, when used in this report, the words ""will,"" ""expects,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""may,"" ""anticipates,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""seeks,"" ""targets,"" ""estimates,"" ""looks for,"" ""looks to,"" ""continues"" and similar expressions, as well as statements regarding our focus for the future, are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this report involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this report. The risks described herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed in fiscal 2023, should be carefully reviewed. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document, except as required by law.\nPART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 32] Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2023. The level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n [source page: 32] Goodwill\n [source page: 32] Description\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.\nWe have goodwill in two reporting units - Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health - with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, respectively, as of January 28, 2023.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 5] Store Development\nWe had 1,138 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel strategy, and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations.\nRefer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.\n [source page: 5] Intellectual Property\nWe own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and trade names, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Essentials, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Mobile, Best Buy Totaltech, CST, Current Health, Dynex, Geek Squad, Insignia, Jitterbug, Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Pacific Sales, Platinum, Rocketfish, TechLiquidators, Yardbird and our Yellow Tag logo.\nWe have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 33] Service Revenue\nDescription\nWe sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support, delivery and installation, price discounts on certain products and services, product protection plans and anti-virus software. We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate There is judgment in (1) measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions A 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023. The amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous Total Tech Support offer.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 32] Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n [source page: 32] Tax Contingencies\n [source page: 32] Description\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2022_10K] \n  [source page: 4] 3M COMPANY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 PART I\n [source page: 4] Item 1.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2023_10K] \n  [source page: 5] Distribution\nCustomers within our Domestic and International segments who purchase product online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curbside pick-up for select products at most Domestic stores), at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers.\n [source page: 5] Suppliers and Inventory\nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony - representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives, and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.\nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 25] COMPARISON OF 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN* Among Best Buy Co., Inc., the S&P 500 and the S&P Retailing Group\n\nBest Buy Co., Inc.\nS&P 500\nS&P Retailing Group\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n0,Fiscal Years Ended,""February 1, 2014"",""January 31, 2015"",""January 30, 2016"",""January 28, 2017"",""February 3, 2018"",""February 2, 2019""\n1,""Best Buy Co., Inc."",$ 100.00,$ 153.08,$ 126.20,$ 205.59,$ 345.38,$ 290.98\n2,S&P 500,100.00,114.22,113.46,136.20,172.17,168.19\n3,S&P Retailing Group,100.00,119.10,140.73,167.11,241.08,256.26\n }\n\n* Cumulative total return assumes dividend reinvestment.

Net earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc. shareholders for fiscal 2016 includes restructuring charges (net of tax and noncontrolling interest) from continuing operations.

(7) Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019.

We do this by solving technology problems and addressing key human needs across a range of areas, including entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., including GreatCall. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 included 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter.

A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\n\n\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.\nThe Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. However, we have not provided International comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018.

In fiscal 2019, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64% of the merchandise we purchased (70% in fiscal 2018), with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG - representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased (56% in fiscal 2018). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value\n\n\n\nand depend upon, to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms.\nWe are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry, may negatively impact our operations.\nWe operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to field employee hourly wage rates, along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates, could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.\n', ""<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 69] 3. Discontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations reflects activity within our International Segment. Fiscal 2018 activity is primarily related to the proceeds attributed to a non-compete clause from the sale of Best Buy Europe to Carphone Warehouse plc. Fiscal 2017 activity is primarily related to the sale of remaining Five Star property assets that were held for sale as of January 30, 2016.\nFiscal 2019 had no financial results from discontinued operations. The aggregate financial results of all discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were as follows ($ in millions):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2\n0,,2018,2017\n1,Gain from discontinued operations before income tax expense,$ 1,$ 28\n2,Income tax expense,-,(7)\n3,Net earnings from discontinued operations,$ 1,$ 21\n }\n\n [source page: 69] 4. Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\n\n\n"", '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 66] Credit Card Revenue\nWe offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. We provide a license to our brand and marketing services, and we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks are the sole owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables related to these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions with customers. We are eligible to receive a profit share from certain of our banking partner based on the annual performance of the program, and we receive quarterly payments based on forecasts of full-year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record such profit share as revenue over time using the most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit-share payments occur quarterly, shortly after the end of each program quarter.\nBest Buy Gift Cards\nWe sell Best Buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do not expire. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed (""breakage""). We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns. Typically, over 90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90% of gift card breakage revenue) occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage income was $34 million , $40 million and $37 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 30] Consolidated Results\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3\n0,Consolidated Performance Summary,2019,2018,2017\n1,Revenue,""$ 42,879"",""$ 42,151"",""$ 39,403""\n2,Revenue % increase (decrease),1.7%,7.0%,(0.3)%\n3,Comparable sales growth (1),4.8%,5.6%,0.3 9\n4,Gross profit,""$ 9,961"",""$ 9,876"",""$ 9,440""\n5,Gross profit as a % of revenue (2),23.2%,23.4%,24.0\n6,SG&A,""$ 8,015"",""$ 8,023"",""$ 7,547""\n7,SG&A as a % of revenue,18.7%,19.0%,19.2%\n8,Restructuring charges,$ 46,$ 10,$ 39\n9,Operating income,""$ 1,900"",""$ 1,843"",""$ 1,854""\n10,Operating income as a % of revenue,4.4%,4.4%,4.7 %\n11,Net earnings from continuing operations,""$ 1,464"",$ 999,""$ 1,207""\n12,Gain from discontinued operations (3),$ -,$ 1,$ 21\n13,Net earnings,""$ 1,464"",""$ 1,000"",""$ 1,228""\n14,Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations,$ 5.20,$ 3.26,$ 3.74\n15,Diluted earnings per share,$ 5.20,$ 3.26,$ 3.81\n }\n\n(1) The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base, and an International segment (comprised of Canada and Mexico) comparable sales metric for the full year was not provided. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue in the International segment was once again determined to be comparable. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019. (2) Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers\' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\n [source page: 5] Working Capital\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n [source page: 5] Competition\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in our stores and in their homes, and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs, provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our broad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs; our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.\n\n\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: BESTBUY_2019_10K] \n  [source page: 33] Fiscal 2018 Results Compared With Fiscal 2017\nDomestic segment revenue of $38.7 billion in fiscal 2018 increased 6.7% compared to fiscal 2017 and includes approximately $715 million of revenue from the extra week. The components of the 6.7% revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2018 were as follows:\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1\n0,Comparable sales impact,5.3%\n1,Non-comparable sales impact (1),1.4%\n2,Total revenue increase,6.7%\n }\n\n\n\n\n(1) Non-comparable sales reflect the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018, as well as the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as profit-share revenue, certain credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Non-comparable sales also reflect the impact of net store opening and closing activity of (0.7)% in fiscal 2018.\nThe profit-share revenue included in our non-comparable sales relates to our extended warranty protection plans that are managed by a third-party underwriter. We may be eligible to receive profit-sharing payments, depending on the performance of the portfolio. When performance of the portfolio is strong and the claims cost to the third-party underwriter declines, we are entitled to share in the excess premiums. In fiscal 2018, we recognized $59 million of such profit-share revenue, with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income. In fiscal 2017, we recognized $110 million of such profit-share revenue. The fiscal 2018 profit-share revenue decrease from fiscal 2017 reflects reductions to the premiums that we pay to the third-party underwriter.\nIn fiscal 2018, Domestic segment online revenue of $6.0 billion increased 21.8% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased to 15.5% versus 13.4% in fiscal 2017.\nThe following table presents the Domestic segment\'s revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2018 and 2017\n\n the following is a CSV table:\n{ ,0,1,2,3,4\n0,,Revenue Mix,Summary,Comparable,Sales Summary\n1,,Year,Ended,Year,Ended\n2,,""February 3, 2018"",""January 28, 2017"",""February 3, 2018"",""January 28, 2017""\n3,Computing and Mobile Phones,45%,45%,5.3%,(1.8)%\n4,Consumer Electronics,33%,34%,3.1%,5.0 o\n5,Appliances,10%,9%,11.4%,7.8%\n6,Entertainment,8%,7%,12.6%,(13.8)%\n7,Services,4%,5%,4.0%,(3.3)%\n8,Total,100%,100%,5.6%,0.2 %\n }\n\nWe believe the strong execution of our business strategy, combined with better product availability, a continued healthy consumer confidence, positive macro conditions and a favorable competitive environment contributed to our Domestic comparable sales growth across most of our categories. The following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our Domestic segment by revenue category:\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 5.3% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and wearables, partially offset by tablets. Consumer Electronics: The 3.1% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by smart home, home theater, headphones and voice assistants, partially offset by health and fitness. Appliances: The 11.4% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by large and small appliances. Entertainment: The 12.6% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming hardware. Services: The 4.0% comparable sales growth was primarily driven by continued growth in our warranty business, and higher installation and delivery services.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit rate to 23.4% in fiscal 2018 from 23.9% in fiscal 2017. This rate decrease was primarily due to the $183 million of cathode ray tube (""CRT"") settlement proceeds recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a decrease in our periodic profit-share revenue as described above, partially offset by improved margin rates across multiple categories.\nOur Domestic segment SG&A rate remained flat at 18.9% of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. SG&A increased in fiscal 2018 due to (1) higher incentive compensation for store and corporate employees, (2) investments in growth initiatives, (3) the impact of the extra week, (4) one-time expenses related to tax reform, which included $75 million related to employee bonus expense and a $20 million charitable donation to the Best Buy Foundation, and (5) higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were offset by cost reductions and $22 million in CRT settlement legal fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that did not recur in fiscal 2018.\nOur Domestic segment incurred $9 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 and $31 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2017. The restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 related to the Best Buy Mobile plan that began in the fourth quarter of\n\n\n\nfiscal 2018, whereas the charges in fiscal 2017 related primarily to the Renew Blue Phase 2 plan that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 9, Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our restructuring activities.\nOur Domestic segment\'s operating income decreased $12 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. In addition, the operating income rate decreased to 4.5% of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to 4.9% of revenue in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the gross profit rate decline and increase in SG&A described above.\n', '<<Paragraph>> [Source File: 3M_2018_10K] \n  [source page: 4] 3M COMPANY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 PART I\n [source page: 4] Item 1.
