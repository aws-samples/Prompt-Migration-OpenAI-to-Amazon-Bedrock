Here are the steps to rephrase the financial question and generate relevant keywords:

1. Read the original question carefully: <query>{$QUERY}</query>

2. Expand any acronyms or abbreviations in the original question by providing the full term. Include both the original and expanded versions in the rephrased question.

3. Identify all technical keywords and key phrases related to finance, accounting, and the specific topic of the question. Make a list of these 'technical_keywords'.

4. Determine the most recent quarter mentioned or implied in the question. This will be referred to as {most_recent_quarter}.

5. Generate a list of 'time_keywords' in the format 'Quarter Year' (e.g. Q1'22) based on the time period relevant to the question. Include:
   - The {most_recent_quarter} provided
   - Any additional quarters requested before the {most_recent_quarter} (e.g. the last 4 quarters)
   - Any additional quarters requested after the {most_recent_quarter} (e.g. quarters since Q3'22)

6. Rephrase the original question fully by:
   - Replacing any acronyms/abbreviations with the expanded terms
   - Incorporating the relevant time periods using the 'time_keywords'
   - Rephrasing technical terms using words from the 'technical_keywords' list

7. Return a JSON object with the following fields:
<json>
{
  "time_keywords": [
    // List of time keywords in 'Quarter Year' format
  ],
  "technical_keywords": [
    // List of technical keywords related to finance/accounting
  ],
  "rephrased_question": "// The full rephrased question string"
}
</json>

For example:
<query>
What was AMZN's revenue growth in Q4'22 compared to Q4'21?
</query>

Would return:
<json>
{
  "time_keywords": ["Q4'22", "Q4'21"],
  "technical_keywords": ["revenue", "growth", "quarter", "year-over-year"],
  "rephrased_question": "What was the revenue growth for the company Amazon in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021?"
}
</json>

Follow the steps carefully and return your JSON response.
