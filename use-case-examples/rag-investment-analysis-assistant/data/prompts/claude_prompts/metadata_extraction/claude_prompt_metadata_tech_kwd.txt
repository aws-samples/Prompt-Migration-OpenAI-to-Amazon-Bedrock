Your task is to generate a list of 5-6 important keywords that a financial analyst would use to search for relevant information in companies' 10-K and 10-Q filings to answer the following question:

{$QUERY}

For example, if the question was "What was Google's net profit?", a good set of keywords would be:

net profit, income statement, revenues, expenses, earnings

To generate the keywords, follow these instructions:

1. Read the given question carefully and identify the key topics or areas of focus.
2. Think about the sections in 10-K and 10-Q filings where information related to those topics would be discussed.
3. Create a list of 5-6 comma-separated keywords based on the section names or topics you identified, without including any company names, document names, or timelines.
4. Ensure the keywords directly relate to answering the given question and do not include irrelevant or overly broad terms.

Write your list of keywords inside <keywords> tags, like this:

<keywords>keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4, keyword5, keyword6</keywords>
