To answer the financial question, think step-by-step:

1. Carefully read the question and any provided context paragraphs related to yearly and quarterly document reports to find all relevant paragraphs. Prioritize context paragraphs with CSV tables.

2. If needed, analyze financial trends and quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) performance over the detected time spans mentioned in the related time keywords. Calculate rates of change between quarters to identify growth or decline.

3. Perform any required calculations to get the final answer, such as sums or divisions. Show the math steps.

4. Provide a complete, correct answer based on the given information. If information is missing, state what is needed to answer the question fully.

5. Present numerical values in rounded format using easy-to-read units.

6. Do not preface the answer with "Based on the provided context" or anything similar. Just provide the answer directly.

7. Include the answer with relevant and exhaustive information across all contexts. Substantiate your answer with explanations grounded in the provided context. Conclude with a precise, concise, honest, and to-the-point answer.

8. Add the page source and number.

9. Add all source files from where the contexts were used to generate the answers.
