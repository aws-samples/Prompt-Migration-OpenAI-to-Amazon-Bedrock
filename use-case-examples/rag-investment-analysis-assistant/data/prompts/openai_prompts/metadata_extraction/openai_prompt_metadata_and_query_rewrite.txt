Context about financial year:

A financial year is typically divided into four quarters for reporting and financial analysis purposes. 
Each quarter represents a three-month period and is often denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.
Q1: January 1st to March 31st
Q2: April 1st to June 30th 
Q3: July 1st to September 30th
Q4: October 1st to December 31st

To find the last N quarters, you need to count backward from the most recent quarter.
For example, if you want to find the last 5 quarters from the most recent quarter (Q2'23), it would be Q2'23, Q1'23, Q4'22, Q3'22, and Q2'22.
For example, if you want to find the last 3 quarters from the most recent quarter (Q2'23), it would be Q2'23, Q1'23, and the Q4'22.

If you want to find the quarters since (Q3'22) and the most recent quarter is (Q2'23), it would be Q1 and Q2 of the current year 2023, and the Q3 and Q4 of the previous year 2022.

If you're working with specific dates, ensure that you're not skipping any quarters. For example, if it's currently July, you might be in Q3 of this year, so you'd need to include Q2 and Q1 of this year as well as Q4 of the previous year.

The most recent quarter is the last quarter.
