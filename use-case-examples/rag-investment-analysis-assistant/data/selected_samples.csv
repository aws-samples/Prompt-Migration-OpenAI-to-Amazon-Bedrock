Increases in debt related to the third quarter 2018 issuance of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes, which was partially offset by the $450 million third quarter repayment and 500 million Euro fourth quarter repayment of maturing medium-term notes, the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects, and lower year on year commercial paper balance. Outstanding commercial paper was $435 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $745 million at December 31, 2017.

Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In conjunction with the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3), the associated non-cash debt-for-debt exchange in the third quarter of 2022 reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness of $350 million (borrowed earlier in the year) which became new term-debt obligations of Neogen. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.| |\n|2021 Debt Activity:| |\n|Decreases in debt were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption of $450 million in debt maturing in 2022 via make-whole call offers and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table.| |\n|Repurchases of Common Stock:| |\n|Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2022, the Company purchased $1,464 million of its own stock.', 'Total sales in China/Hong Kong grew 16 percent and Japan grew 5 percent. On an organic local-currency sales basis, China/Hong Kong grew 18 percent and Japan grew 8 percent.| |\n|In the EMEA geographic area, West Europe total sales grew 5 percent, with organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent along with an increase related to foreign currency translation.| |\n|In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 4 percent in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales growth of 6 percent was partially offset by divestitures. In Canada, total sales increased 8 percent, with organic-local currency sales growth of 7 percent. In Brazil total sales growth of 9 percent was driven by foreign currency translation, while organic local-currency sales increased 2 percent.| |\n|25| |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Foreign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.5 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in Latin America/Canada and EMEA partially offset by the decreases in Asia Pacific. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.| |\n|Financial condition:| |\n|3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February 2019, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.| |\n|Raw materials:| |\n|In 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.| |\n|Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:| |\n|On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2018 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were - 0.5%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%. The primary U.S.', 'Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities:\n\n|Years Ended December 31|2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Net income including noncontrolling interest|$5,363|$4,869|$5,058|\n|Depreciation and amortization|1,488|1,544|1,474|\n|Company pension and postretirement contributions|(370)|(967)|(383)|\n|Company pension and postretirement expense|410|334|250|\n|Stock-based compensation expense|302|324|298|\n|Gain on sale of businesses|(545)|(586)|(111)|\n|Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes)|77|1,074|108|\n|Accounts receivable|(305)|(245)|(313)|\n|Inventories|(509)|(387)|57|\n|Accounts payable|408|24|148|\n|Other — net|120|256|76|\n|Net cash provided by operating activities|$6,439|$6,240|$6,662|\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\n\nIn 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.\n\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n|Years ended December 31|2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)|$(1,577)|$(1,373)|$(1,420)|\n|Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets|262|49|58|\n|Acquisitions, net of cash acquired|13|(2,023)|(16)|\n|Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net|669|(798)|(163)|\n|Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold|846|1,065|142|\n|Other — net|9|(6)|(4)|\n|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|$222|$(3,086)|$(1,403)|\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.| |\n|3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities.', '- The stationery and office supplies business declined due to channel inventory adjustments, primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale market.\n\nOperating income:\n\n- Operating income margins declined 1.8 percentage points year-on-year, in part due to incremental strategic investments, which reduced margins by 1.8 percentage points.\n\nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 19.\n\nRefer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Geographic Area Supplemental Information| |\n|Property, Plant and Equipment - net| |\n\n| |Employees as of December 31, 2018|Employees as of December 31, 2017|Employees as of December 31, 2016|Capital Spending as of December 31, 2018|Capital Spending as of December 31, 2017|Capital Spending as of December 31, 2016|Net Property, Plant and Equipment as of December 31, 2018|Net Property, Plant and Equipment as of December 31, 2017|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|United States|37,412|36,958|35,748|$ 994|$ 852|$ 834|$ 4,915|$ 4,891|\n|Asia Pacific|18,971|18,283|18,124|$ 238|$ 209|$ 228|$ 1,624|$ 1,672|\n|Europe, Middle East and Africa|20,884|20,869|20,203|$ 295|$ 256|$ 294|$ 1,751|$ 1,798|\n|Latin America and Canada|16,249|15,426|17,509|$ 50|$ 56|$ 64|$ 448|$ 505|\n|Total Company|93,516|91,536|91,584|$ 1,577|$ 1,373|$ 1,420|$ 8,738|$ 8,866|\n\nEmployment:\n\nEmployment increased 1,980 positions in 2018 and decreased by 48 positions in 2017.\n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2018, 63% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.\n\nLegal Proceedings:\n\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings.', 'The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.| |\n|In 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.| |\n|In 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow.

Refer to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.| |\n|In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property.', '3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.| |\n|3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.| |\n|Total Debt:| |\n|The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.| |\n|The Company’s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.| |\n|Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.| |\n|As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.| |\n|In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period.', 'This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018.

This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.| |\n---\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\nAt December 31, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by pe Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by pe United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and oper high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by pe Company’s foreign subsidiaries and by pe United States totaled approximately $3.975 billion and $180 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 11.\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed pe same as similarly titled measures used by oper companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less pe total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\n| |December 31, 2018|2018 versus 2017|\n|---|---|---|\n|(Millions)| |2018|2017|2017|\n|Total debt|$14,622|$13,949|$673|\n|Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities|$3,270|$4,156|($886)|\n| |Net debt (non-GAAP measure)|$11,352|$9,793|$1,559|\n\nRefer to the preceding “Total Debt” and “Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” sections for additional details.\n\nBalance Sheet:\n3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide pe Company wip significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\n\nWorking capital decreased $125 million compared with December 31, 2017. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $568 million, driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $443 million, primarily due to decreases in short-term debt.\n\nAccounts receivable increased $109 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased sales.', '---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Table of Contents|3|\n|3M Company and Subsidiaries|3|\n|Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows|3|\n|Years ended December 31|3|\n\n| |2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Net income including noncontrolling interest|$5,363|$4,869|$5,058|\n|Adjustments to reconcile net income including noncontrolling interest to net cash provided by operating activities| | | |\n|Depreciation and amortization|1,488|1,544|1,474|\n|Company pension and postretirement contributions|(370)|(967)|(383)|\n|Company pension and postretirement expense|410|334|250|\n|Stock-based compensation expense|302|324|298|\n|Gain on sale of businesses|(545)|(586)|(111)|\n|Deferred income taxes|(57)|107|7|\n|Changes in assets and liabilities| | | |\n|Accounts receivable|(305)|(245)|(313)|\n|Inventories|(509)|(387)|57|\n|Accounts payable|408|24|148|\n|Accrued income taxes (current and long-term)|134|967|101|\n|Other — net|120|256|76|\n|Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities|6,439|6,240|6,662|\n\n| |2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Cash Flows from Investing Activities| | | |\n|Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)|(1,577)|(1,373)|(1,420)|\n|Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets|262|49|58|\n|Acquisitions, net of cash acquired|13|(2,023)|(16)|\n|Purchases of marketable securities and investments|(1,828)|(2,152)|(1,410)|\n|Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments|2,497|1,354|1,247|\n|Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold|846|1,065|142|\n|Other — net|9|(6)|(4)|\n|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|222|(3,086)|(1,403)|\n\n| |2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Cash Flows from Financing Activities| | | |\n|Change in short-term debt — net|(284)|578|(797)|\n|Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)|(1,034)|(962)|(992)|\n|Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)|2,251|1,987|2,832|\n|Purchases of treasury stock|(4,870)|(2,068)|(3,753)|\n|Proceeds from issuance of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and benefit plans|485|734|804|\n|Dividends paid to shareholders|(3,193)|(2,803)|(2,678)|\n|Other — net|(56)|(121)|(42)|\n|Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities|(6,701)|(2,655)|(4,626)|\n\n| |2018|2017|2016|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents|(160)|156|(33)|\n|Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents|(200)|655|600|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year|3,053|2,398|1,798|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at end of period|$2,853|$3,053|$2,398|\n\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements| |\n|NOTE 1.

The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\n\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIn 2022, 3M expended approximately $317 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $646 million for 2023 and 2024 in aggregate.\n\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.', 'The Company expects 2023 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.|39|\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance.

The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In conjunction with the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3), the associated non-cash debt-for-debt exchange in the third quarter of 2022 reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness of $350 million (borrowed earlier in the year) which became new term-debt obligations of Neogen. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances.

Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.| |\n|Environmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.

Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.| |\n|Income taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.

Business. 3M Company was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations begun in 1902. The Company’s ticker symbol is MMM. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” includes 3M Company and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. In this document, for any references to Note 1 through Note 19, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Available Information The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that the Company files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company files annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). 3M also makes available free of charge through its website (http://investors.3M.com) the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. General 3M is a diversified technology company with a global presence in the following businesses: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M is among the leading manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. Most 3M products involve expertise in product development, manufacturing and marketing, and are subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other technologically oriented companies. Business Segments 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3M’s four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information).', '3M expects to initially retain a 19.9% ownership position in the Health Care business.| |\n|Year 2021 results:| |\n|Sales in Health Care were up 9.8 percent in U.S. dollars.| |\n|On an organic sales basis:| |\n|Sales increased in oral care, separation and purification, food safety, health information systems and medical solutions.| |\n|Growth benefited from higher year-on-year dental procedures, continued high demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic development and manufacturing, rising elective procedure volumes in the first six months of 2021 and due to improving hospital information technology investments.| |\n|Divestitures:| |\n|In May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.| |\n|Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges that were partially offset by supply chain disruptions, increases in raw materials and logistics costs, deal-related costs associated with the announced divestiture of the food safety business (see Note 3), manufacturing productivity impacts, increased compensation and benefit costs, and increased investments in growth.| |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Consumer Business (15.5% of consolidated sales):| |\n|Sales (millions)| |\n|2022|2021|\n|$ 5,298|$ 5,513|\n|Sales change analysis:| |\n|Organic sales|(0.9) %|\n|Divestitures|(0.4)|\n|Translation|(2.6)|\n|Total sales change|(3.9) %|\n|Business segment operating income (millions)| |\n|$ 994|$ 1,162|\n|Percent change|(14.4) %|\n|Percent of sales|18.8 %|\n|Year 2022 results:| |\n|Sales in Consumer were down 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars.| |\n|On an organic sales basis:| |\n|Sales increased in stationery and office and home care, was flat in consumer health and safety, and decreased in home improvement.| |\n|Growth was impacted by softening trends in the Consumer retail business as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and retailers took actions to reduce their inventories. These impacts were partially offset by demand for Scotch Blue TM painter’s tape, Scotch-Brite TM, and Post-it®-solutions.| |\n|Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as a result of increased raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds and investments in the business, partially offset by sales growth (including selling price actions), strong spending discipline and restructuring actions.| |\n|Year 2021 results:| |\n|Sales in Consumer were up 10.8 percent in U.S. dollars.| |\n|On an organic sales basis:| |\n|Sales increased in stationery and office, home improvement, consumer health and safety and home care.| |\n|Growth driven by continued strength in the market with strong demand for Command adhesives, Filtrete air quality solutions, Meguiars auto care and Scotch Blue painter’s tape and from ongoing strength in demand for packaging and shipping products, Post-it-solutions and Scotch brand office tapes as the business laps last year’s COVID-related comparisons.| |\n|Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as a result of increases in raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs that more than offset leverage from sales growth and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.| |\n|PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA| |\n|While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.', ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.| |\n|Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M’s MD&A is presented in eight sections:| |\n|Overview| |\n|Results of Operations| |\n|Performance by Business Segment| |\n|Performance by Geographic Area| |\n|Critical Accounting Estimates| |\n|New Accounting Pronouncements| |\n|Financial Condition and Liquidity| |\n|Financial Instruments| |\n|Forward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). Additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections in 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 26, 2022 (which updated 3M's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K).| |\n|OVERVIEW| |\n|3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made the following changes:| |\n|Changes in measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker—impacting 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2.| |\n|Changes to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.| |\n|Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.| |\n|3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.| |\n|3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this document. Given the diversity of 3M’s businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Item 7. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M’s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.| |\n|In 2022, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). These matters are further discussed in Note 16. In 2022, 3M also completed the split-off of its Food Safety Division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in Note 15."", 'Refer to the section entitled ""Performance by Business Segment"" later in MD&A for additional discussion concerning 2022 versus 2021 results, including Corporate and Unallocated.

In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales increased 17 percent which included increased organic sales of 11 percent. In Japan, total sales were flat which included increased organic sales of 2 percent.| |\n|Managing currency risks:| |\n|The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Company’s hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.| |\n|Financial condition:| |\n|Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.| |\n|In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization.

The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 70 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 97 percent funded and the international pension plans were 116 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2022 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -17.4 percent, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2023 is 7.5 percent. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2022 discount rate was 5.18%, up 2.29 percentage points from the year-end 2021 discount rate of 2.89%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status remained at 97% as of December 31, 2022 due to the lower PBO resulting from the discount rate increase, offset by the negative returns of the plan's assets.

Therefore, based on the information available, it's not possible to determine Adobe's operating margin profile for FY2022 or its trend over time.

Furthermore, the context does not suggest that operating margin is not a useful metric for Adobe. Typically, operating margin is a critical financial metric for evaluating the efficiency and profitability of a company, including those in the software and digital services sectors like Adobe. It provides insights into how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales before interest and taxes, reflecting the core profitability of the company's business operations. Without specific financial data or management commentary on the matter, it's not appropriate to conclude that operating margin is not a useful metric for Adobe.","['BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES| |\n|Operations| |\n|Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW\n\nFounded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997.', 'We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and ISVs that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We also maintain several strategic partnerships with other technology companies that allow us to increase our market reach. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market and believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Publishing and Advertising\n\nOur Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Table of Contents| |\n|COMPETITION| |\n|Overview| |\n|Digital Media| |\n|Digital Experience| |\n\nAdobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for this industry. Adobe Advertising Cloud delivers an end-to-end, demand-side platform for managing advertising across digital formats and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.\n\nWe generate revenue in our legacy Publishing products and services by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output devices, and we generally generate revenue in Advertising through usage-based offerings.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nOverview Adobe participates in a highly competitive environment globally, where our competitors vary by industry segment and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller entities with more narrowly focused product offerings. Across our business, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide. The markets for our products and services are characterized by new industry standards, evolving distribution models, technology innovation, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.\n\nA summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is included below:\n\n### Digital Media\n\nOur Digital Media segment faces competition from large, established companies as well as a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. We compete in a constantly evolving market and face significant direct or indirect competition from software companies; device, hardware and camera manufacturers; operating system developers that integrate digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems; smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software; proprietary and open source web-authoring tools; mobile-first applications; web-native tools and platforms; social media platforms that provide imaging and video offerings, including editing capabilities; stock content marketplaces; and digital document creation, storage, collaboration and signing providers.\n\nWe believe competitive factors in our markets include brand leadership, product features and functionalities; integration with related tools and third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; usability and accessibility on multiple devices, including mobile and desktop; and success in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud or Document Cloud. We are a leader through our ability to offer a very broad and comprehensive array of products and services through our Adobe Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we believe we compete well with our features and functionality, ease of use, product reliability, value and performance characteristics. With Adobe Express, we believe we compete well by making our professional creative technology accessible to a wider audience of first-time creators, communicators and creative professionals and enabling easy-to-use, efficient content creation for quick projects. With Document Cloud, we believe we compete well based on the global use of PDF, our features and functionalities, which are critical tools for millions of business communicators, and our brand leadership.\n\n### Digital Experience\n\nOur Digital Experience business unit competes in markets that are growing rapidly and characterized by intense competition.', 'We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models.

RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.\n\n### Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, new technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers.\n\nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result could harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.', 'We are empowering anyone, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit, schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which employs powerful capabilities from our flagship products like Photoshop, Premiere and Acrobat to deliver the best of Adobe to customers at any level.

We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is a large and growing opportunity and we are in position to help businesses and enterprises invest in solutions that aid their goals to transform how they engage with their customers and constituents digitally.|6|\n---\n## Strategy\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur goal is to be a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for delivering digital experiences and enabling digital transformation. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications and services are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. The Adobe Experience Platform further strengthens our differentiation by offering a way to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.\n\nAdobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:\n\n- Data insights and audiences. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver actionable data in real time to provide highly tailored and adaptive experiences across platforms.\n- Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and build multi-channel commerce experiences for B2B and B2C customers on a single platform with Adobe Commerce.\n- Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target, personalize and deliver campaigns and customer journeys across B2B and B2C use cases, including through Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer.\n- Marketing workflows. Adobe Workfront is an enterprise work management application that allows businesses to strategically plan, manage, collaborate and execute on workflows for marketing campaigns and other projects at speed and scale.\n\nWe also believe the AI and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances the delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Experience Cloud offers domain-specific AI services powered by Adobe Sensei that work with Adobe Experience Platform to augment existing Experience Cloud product offerings. These AI services help provide domain-specific intelligence in areas such as attribution and automated insights, customer journey management, lead management, sentiment analysis, one-click personalization, enhanced anomaly detection and more. By building on existing features and these AI-powered services, we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.\n\nAdobe Experience Cloud also offers an open platform and ecosystem through the Adobe Experience Platform, AI services, and developer services through Adobe I/O. Adobe Experience Platform is the foundation of our Adobe Experience Cloud products, with an open system that transforms user data from across Adobe solutions and third-party software into robust customer profiles. Adobe customer profiles are updated in real time and include AI-driven insights to deliver the right customer experiences across channels. This open architecture offers scalability with a wide variety of supporting products and services, empowers users to quickly develop innovative applications to interact with customers and enables a broad industry ecosystem.\n\nTo drive growth of Adobe Experience Cloud, we are focused on delivering the best customer experience management solutions across B2B and B2C buyers, and both enterprise and mid-market segments. We also intend to focus on personalization at scale, customer engagement, growth within existing customer accounts and product differentiation. We are continuing to add new services, functionality and features to our current offerings. Some examples include a new algorithm in Adobe Target that utilizes machine learning to provide recommendations and tools that allow developers to optimize page load performance and deliver personalized experiences more quickly. We are also delivering new and improved integrations, such as increased synergy between our Experience Cloud products and Creative Cloud and Adobe Acrobat Sign. Within our established base of customers, we intend to pursue growth through a scaled go-to-market approach focused on C-suite partnerships, transformational accounts, continued customer acquisition, customer value realization and solution expansion. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and ISVs that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We also maintain several strategic partnerships with other technology companies that allow us to increase our market reach. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market and believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Publishing and Advertising\n\nOur Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings.', 'The United States, countries in the EU and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\n\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.\n\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.\n\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.\n---\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets. Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of November 27, 2015, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe following table sets forth the location, approximate square footage and use of each of the principal properties used by Adobe during fiscal 2015. We lease or sublease all of these properties with the exception of our property in Noida, India where we own the building and lease the land, in Lehi where we own the building and land, in San Francisco at 601 and 625 Townsend Street where we own the building and land, and our corporate offices in San Jose where we own the land and the East and West tower buildings and lease the Almaden Tower building. All leased properties are leased under operating leases. Such leases expire at various times through 2028, with the exception of our land lease in Noida, India that expires in 2091. The annual base rent expense (including operating expenses, property taxes and assessments, as applicable) for all leased facilities is currently approximately $87.3 million and is subject to annual adjustments as well as changes in interest rates.']"

This increase in cash flows from operations is a key component of free cash flow, which is calculated as cash flows from operations minus capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment). The documents indicate that purchases of property and equipment (capital expenditures) were $442 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $348 million in fiscal 2021. Despite the increase in capital expenditures, the significant increase in cash flows from operations suggests an improvement in free cash flow conversion for Adobe in fiscal year 2022.","['There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement at the time of termination.

Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.| |\n|Reclassifications| |\n|Certain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.| |\n|Significant Accounting Policies| |\n|Revenue Recognition| |\n|Our revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support.

Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long- term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions and the Almaden Tower purchase, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock. For fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and|50|\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Table of Contents|51|\n|Investments totaled $5.82 billion as of December 1, 2017. Of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. As of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.| |\n|Subsequent to December 1, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S.', 'We are empowering anyone, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit, schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which employs powerful capabilities from our flagship products like Photoshop, Premiere and Acrobat to deliver the best of Adobe to customers at any level. We are continuing to integrate collaboration capabilities into our applications and workflows such as our native integration of Frame.io’s review and approval capabilities into Premiere Pro and After Effects. Similarly, our new Share for Review feature in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign provides an efficient way for creators to seamlessly request, manage and view feedback from stakeholders that makes exporting to other formats, emailing files, tracking versions and keeping track feedback across different channels obsolete. We are expanding the capabilities of Creative Cloud on the web with improvements to our public beta web versions of Photoshop and Illustrator, which allow subscribers to edit and review their files directly in their browser. Other new features and solutions introduced in our products include Substance 3D Modeler, a new desktop and VR application for creating 3D objects; AI-powered quick actions and social media content scheduling in Adobe Express; direct video upload from select cameras to Frame.io with Camera to Cloud; and improved AI-powered neural filters and content-aware editing in Photoshop and Lightroom. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications.| |\n|We are pursuing new ways to inspire, empower and connect the creative community, such as through our Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including libraries of creative assets, such as Adobe Stock and Adobe Fonts; mobile-first apps, such as Lightroom Mobile; and Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal Products and Services.”| |\n|In our Creative Cloud business, we employ our product-led growth strategy to minimize the friction of customer interactions and drive positive product experiences, which results in increasing customer adoption, conversion, expansion and loyalty. We also continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to migrate our customers to higher-value offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. We use a data-driven operating model and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to drive and optimize customer awareness, engagement and licensing of our creative products and services at every stop of the customer journey through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual| |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Adobe Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model and product-led growth strategy to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval, copywriting, social media marketing or other social content. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users, attract new customers and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, we expect to drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to employ our product-led growth strategy, deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web’s functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat and integrate Adobe Acrobat Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces. We also intend to drive innovation with Adobe Sensei, our cross-platform AI and machine learning technology, to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Acrobat Sign APIs, accelerate Document Cloud adoption through direct sales, and leverage diversified go-to-market motions to reach all segments.', 'In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed.

While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine.

58","56,60","To calculate the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) percentage margin for AMD, we need to use the figures provided in the statement of cash flows and the income statement (P&L statement). From the statement of cash flows, the depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 26, 2015, is $167 million. From the P&L statement, the net revenue for FY2015 is $3,991 million ($958 million + $1,061 million + $942 million + $1,030 million).

The D&A % margin is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{D&A % Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Depreciation and Amortization Expense}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{D&A % Margin} = \left( \frac{167}{3,991} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.18\% \]

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.', 'Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above.\n\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6th Generation AMD A-Series mobile processors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU designed to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and R9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power efficiency for notebooks and best-in-class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170, designed for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and a unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both small and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and performance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay.\n---\nto our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media storage and communications and networking.\n\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating expenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan). The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We realized operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $8 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $48 million in 2016.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co.', 'Cost of sales decreased mainly due to lower unit shipments in 2014.

Total debt as of December 26, 2015 was $2.26 billion, compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014.\n\nGLOBALFOUNDRIES\n\nFormation and Accounting\n\nOn March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (currently known as Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009.\n\nAt GF’s formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be GF’s primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, we deconsolidated GF and accounted for our GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, our ownership in GF was diluted, and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011.\n\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.', 'net|(1,091)|(640)|(219)|\n|Inventories|(1,401)|(556)|(417)|\n|Receivables from related parties|(13)|8|10|\n|Prepaid expenses and other assets|(1,197)|(920)|(231)|\n|Payables to related parties|379|7|(135)|\n|Accounts payable|931|801|(513)|\n|Accrued liabilities and other|546|526|574|\n|Net cash provided by operating activities|3,565|3,521|1,071|\n|Cash flows from investing activities:| |\n|Purchases of property and equipment|(450)|(301)|(294)|\n|Purchases of short-term investments|(2,667)|(2,056)|(850)|\n|Proceeds from maturity of short-term investments|4,310|1,678|192|\n|Cash received from acquisition of Xilinx|2,366| | |\n|Acquisition of Pensando, net of cash acquired|(1,544)| | |\n|Other|(16)|(7)| |\n|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|1,999|(686)|(952)|\n|Cash flows from financing activities:| |\n|Proceeds from debt, net of issuance costs|991| |200|\n|Repayment of debt|(312)| |(200)|\n|Proceeds from sales of common stock through employee equity plans|167|104|85|\n|Repurchases of common stock|(3,702)|(1,762)| |\n|Common stock repurchases for tax withholding on employee equity plans|(406)|(237)|(78)|\n|Other|(2)| |(1)|\n|Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities|(3,264)|(1,895)|6|\n|Net increase in cash and cash equivalents|2,300|940|125|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year|2,535|1,595|1,470|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at end of year|$4,835|$2,535|$1,595|\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.| |\n|Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows| |\n|Year Ended| |\n| | |\n|December 31, 2022| |\n|December 25, 2021| |\n|December 26, 2020| |\n\n|Supplemental cash flow information:| |\n|---|---|\n|Cash paid during the year for:| |\n|Interest|$ 85|\n|Income taxes, net of refund|$ 685|\n|Non-cash investing and financing activities:| |\n|Purchases of property and equipment, accrued but not paid|$ 157|\n|Issuance of common stock to settle convertible debt|$ —|\n|Issuance of common stock and treasury stock for the acquisition of Xilinx|$ 48,514|\n|Fair value of replacement share-based awards related to acquisition of Xilinx|$ 275|\n|Transfer of assets for the acquisition of property and equipment|$ 13|\n|Non-cash activities for leases:| |\n|Operating lease right-of-use assets acquired by assuming related liabilities|$ 115|\n\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above.\n\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6th Generation AMD A-Series mobile processors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU designed to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and R9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power efficiency for notebooks and best-in-class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170, designed for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and a unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both small and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and performance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay.\n---\nto our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media storage and communications and networking.\n\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating expenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan). The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We realized operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $8 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $48 million in 2016.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co.', 'In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure. As a result of this organizational change, we have the following two reportable segments:\n\npe Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics;\npe Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties;\n\nIn addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does\n---\nnot consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other special charges, net, technology node transition charge, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge, significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\nWe use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 each included 52 weeks.

Unit shipments of all our Computing and Graphics products decreased. The decrease in unit shipments of all categories of products was due to lower demand caused by challenging global macroeconomic conditions, especially in the Greater China region, in addition to increased competitive pressures and reduced demand from our OEM customers in advance of the Microsoft Windows® 10 operating system. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our notebook GPU products and AIB products due to a favorable shift in our product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our notebook microprocessor products and chipset products.\n\nComputing and Graphics net revenue of $3.1 billion in 2014 decreased by 16% compared to $3.7 billion in 2013 as a result of a 27% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 15% increase in average selling price.', 'This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments.

International operations reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below.\n\n(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2022 amount includes the impact of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA that became effective in fiscal 2022. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below.\n\n(3) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 9.1% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate. As part of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company has recognized approximately $0.5 billion in net incremental tax costs in fiscal year 2022, which increased the 2022 effective tax rate by approximately 2.2%.\n\nAdditionally, the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in an unfavorable impact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are described below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment of bermekimab for AD and HS IPR&D (for further information see Note 5 of the 2022 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements) and changes in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.\n\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\n\n- approximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n- approximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation.', 'Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K.\n\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.\n---\n|Years Ended December 31,|2022|2021|2020|2022 vs. 2021|2021 vs.', '135|\n|Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:| | | |\n|Provisions for credit losses|2,182|(1,419)|4,730|\n|Depreciation and amortization|1,626|1,695|1,543|\n|Stock-based compensation|375|330|249|\n|Deferred taxes|(1,189)|294|(939)|\n|Other items (a)|365|(772)|683|\n|Originations of loans held-for-sale|(277)| | |\n|Proceeds from sales of loans held-for-sale|277| | |\n|Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and dispositions:| | | |\n|Other assets|1,391|1,068|(1,785)|\n|Accounts payable & other liabilities|8,815|5,389|(2,025)|\n|Net cash provided by operating activities|21,079|14,645|5,591|\n|Cash Flows from Investing Activities| | | |\n|Sale of investment securities|26|62|69|\n|Maturities and redemptions of investment securities|1,892|20,032|7,159|\n|Purchase of investments|(4,175)|(1,517)|(20,562)|\n|Net (increase) decrease in Card Member loans and receivables, and other loans|(29,562)|(27,557)|26,906|\n|Purchase of premises and equipment, net of sales: 2022, $1; 2021, $88; 2020, $1|(1,855)|(1,550)|(1,478)|\n|Acquisitions/dispositions, net of cash acquired|(15)|1|(597)|\n|Other investing activities| | |135|\n|Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities|(33,689)|(10,529)|11,632|\n|Cash Flows from Financing Activities| | | |\n|Net increase (decrease) in customer deposits|25,902|(2,468)|13,542|\n|Net (decrease) increase in short-term borrowings|(706)|461|(4,627)|\n|Proceeds from long-term debt|23,230|7,788|69|\n|Payments of long-term debt|(18,906)|(11,662)|(15,593)|\n|Issuance of American Express preferred shares| |1,584| |\n|Redemption of American Express preferred shares| |(1,600)| |\n|Issuance of American Express common shares|56|64|44|\n|Repurchase of American Express common shares and other|(3,502)|(7,652)|(1,029)|\n|Dividends paid|(1,565)|(1,448)|(1,474)|\n|Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities|24,509|(14,933)|(9,068)|\n|Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents|(13)|(120)|364|\n|Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents|11,886|(10,937)|8,519|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year|22,028|32,965|24,446|\n|Cash and cash equivalents at end of year|$ 33,914|$ 22,028|$ 32,965|\n|Supplemental cash flow information| | | |\n|Cash and cash equivalents reconciliation|2022|2021|2020|\n|Cash and cash equivalents per Consolidated Balance Sheets|$ 33,914|$ 22,028|$ 32,965|\n|Restricted balances included in Cash and cash equivalents|544|525|606|\n|Total cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted balances|$ 33,370|$ 21,503|$ 32,359|\n|(a) Includes net gains and losses on fair value hedges, net gains and losses on Amex Ventures investments and changes in equity method investments.| | | |\n|See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.| | | |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY| |\n|Additional Paid-in Capital| |\n|Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)| |\n|Retained Earnings| |\n\n|Total|Preferred Shares|Common Shares|Additional Paid-in Capital|Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)|Retained Earnings|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Balances as of December 31, 2019|$23,071|$—|$163|$11,774|$(2,737)|$13,']"

The reserve builds in the current year were primarily driven by increases in loans and receivables outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves for Card Member loans. The reserve releases in the prior year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by increases in loans and receivables outstanding.\n\nOther provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to a net reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period.|91|\n|Membership Rewards Liability As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management’s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.|91|\n|Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.| |\n|Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.| |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|OTHER MATTERS| |\n|As previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.| |\n|Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.| |\n|Reserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans| |\n|As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company’s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company’s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company’s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.| |\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal 2018 includes approximately $45 million of revenue from the extra week.

However, the gross profit rate decreased to 22.9% in fiscal 2019 from 23.2% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in gross profit rate in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased revenue in the higher-margin services category.\n\nOur International segment's SG&A decreased $4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, and the SG&A rate decreased to 20.0% in fiscal 2019 from 20.6% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in SG&A in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the absence of the extra week, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the absence of a one-time employee bonus expense related to tax reform. These decreases were partially offset by higher variable costs associated with increased revenue.\n\nOur International segment recorded a restructuring benefit of $1 million and restructuring charges of $1 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restructuring activity in both years relates to adjustments to our vacant space liabilities outstanding as a result of the Canadian brand consolidation and the Renew Blue plans. The adjustments were due to changes in estimates related to sublease income. Refer to Note 9, Restructuring Charges, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our restructuring activities.\n\nOur International segment operating income was $103 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $91 million in fiscal 2018.

All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nIn order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our Mexico operations on a one-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. No significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nDiscontinued operations are primarily comprised of activity related to Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., Limited (""Five Star"") within our International segment. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for further information.\n\n## Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January.

While there are yearly variations, these changes are within a roughly 2% range, suggesting that gross margins are a relevant and relatively consistent metric for Best Buy. This consistency in gross profit rates demonstrates Best Buy's ability to manage its cost of goods sold and maintain profitability over different fiscal periods.","[""This trend, which primarily related to mobile phones, was a reflection of changes to the design of our extended protection plans, improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends.| |\n|Our Domestic segment experienced an increase in gross profit of $ 404 million , or 5.0% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 . Excluding the $88 million of CRT/LCD litigation settlement proceeds received in fiscal 2016, we experienced an increase in gross profit of $316 million, or 3.9%. Refer to Note 12, Contingencies and Commitments , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. This rate increase was primarily due to (1) the periodic profit-share revenue described above; (2) rate improvements in computing hardware driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy; (3) an additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; (4) the positive impact of lower repair revenue (as discussed above), which typically earns a low gross profit rate; (5) an increased mix of higher-margin large screen televisions; and (6) positive revenue impact related to our credit card portfolio. These increases were partially offset by (1) lower rates related to large appliances; (2) a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher priced iconic mobile phones, which have higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate; (3) decrease in margin for portable audio products; (4) a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products; (5) an increased mix of lower-margin wearable devices; and (6) an investment in services pricing.| |\n|Our Domestic segment's SG&A increased $ 258 million , or 3.9% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 . In addition, the SG&A rate increased to 19.0% of revenue compared to 18.4% of revenue in the prior year. The increases in SG&A and SG&A rate were primarily driven by investments in growth initiatives, a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A and higher incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by the implementation of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions.| |\n|Our Domestic segment recorded $2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016 and incurred $4 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 .

In addition, the operating income rate increased to 4.4% of revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to 4.0% of revenue in the prior year.

In fiscal 2015, we began selling installment billing plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional two-year plans. While the two types of contracts have broadly similar overall economics, installment billing plans typically generate higher revenues due to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of sales due to lower device subsidies. As we increased our mix of installment billing plans, we had an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods sold and a decrease in gross profit rate, with gross profit dollars relatively unaffected. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we no longer reported comparable sales, excluding the estimated revenue benefit from installment billing, as the mix of installment billing plans became comparable on a year-over-year basis.\n\n|Fiscal 2015|Fiscal 2016|Fiscal 2017|\n|---|---|---|\n|Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year|Stores Opened|Stores Closed|Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year|Stores Opened|Stores Closed|Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year|\n|Best Buy|1,050| |(13)|1,037| |(11)|1,026|\n|Best Buy Mobile stand-alone|367| |(17)|350| |(41)|309|\n|Pacific Sales|29| |(1)|28| | |28|\n|Magnolia Audio Video|2| |(2)| | | | |\n|Total Domestic segment stores|1,448| |(33)|1,415| |(52)|1,363|\n\nWe continuously monitor store performance.

A higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers, who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage. Some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. In addition, in the U.S., online-only operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states. We believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are re-evaluated at both the state and federal levels. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers, and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have a price-matching policy in the U.S. that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, integrated online and retail assets, broad product assortment, strong vendor relationships, range of focused service and support offerings, distinct store formats, brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nBest Buy is committed to positively impacting the environment and our communities. We believe that effectively managing our environmental impacts, setting sustainability goals and advancing energy-efficient consumer solutions create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We are continuously looking for cost-effective solutions to minimize carbon emissions in our operations. In fiscal year 2016, we set a new goal to reduce our own carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2020 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. See our Best Buy Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report for further information on environmental performance.\n\n## Number of Employees\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2017, we employed approximately 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and our sourcing office in China. We consider our employee relations to be good. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Available Information| |\n|We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and its rules and regulations.

The ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers.\n\nInternational Segment\n\nOur Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to our Domestic segment model.\n\n## Suppliers and Inventory\n\nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2017, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, and LG Electronics – representing approximately 53% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\n\nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.\n\nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brand products.\n\n## Store Development\n\nWe had approximately 1,200 large-format and 400 small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2017 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our omni-channel strategy and represent an important competitive advantage. In the U.S., we have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores. Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores. In recent years, we have opened vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a better quality customer experience. In fiscal 2018 and beyond, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiating leases and selectively opening or closing locations to support our operations.\n\nIn March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand.\n\nRefer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Intellectual Property| |\n|Seasonality| |\n|Working Capital| |\n|Competition| |\n|Environmental Matters| |\n|Number of Employees| |\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Dynex, Geek Squad, Insignia, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Sales, Rocketfish, Platinum and our Yellow Tag logo. We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers, who offer their products and services directly to customers."", 'shareholders|1,464|1,000|1,228|897|1,233|\n\n|Per Share Data| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Net earnings from continuing operations|$5.20|$3.26|$3.74|$2.30|$3.53|\n|Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations|-|-|0.07|0.26|(0.04)|\n|Net earnings|5.20|3.26|3.81|2.56|3.49|\n|Cash dividends declared and paid|1.80|1.36|1.57|1.43|0.72|\n\n|Operating Statistics| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comparable sales growth|4.8%|5.6%|0.3%|0.5%|0.5%|\n|Gross profit rate|23.2%|23.4%|24.0%|23.3%|22.4%|\n|Selling, general and administrative expenses rate|18.7%|19.0%|19.2%|19.3%|18.8%|\n|Operating income rate|4.4%|4.4%|4.7%|3.5%|3.6%|\n\n|Year-End Data| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Current ratio|1.2|1.3|1.5|1.4|1.5|\n|Total assets|$12,901|$13,049|$13,856|$13,519|$15,245|\n|Debt, including current portion|1,388|1,355|1,365|1,734|1,613|\n|Total equity|3,306|3,612|4,709|4,378|5,000|\n|Number of stores|Domestic (9)|1,026|1,298|1,369|1,416|1,449|\n| |International|212|216|212|216|283|\n| |Total|1,238|1,514|1,581|1,632|1,732|\n|Retail square footage (in thousands)|Domestic (9)|39,500|40,360|41,039|41,234|41,734|\n| |International|4,607|4,602|4,511|4,543|6,470|\n| |Total|44,107|44,962|45,550|45,777|48,204|\n\n(1) Included within operating income, net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc. shareholders for fiscal 2019 is $46 million ($35 million net of taxes) of restructuring charges from continuing operations related to measures we took to restructure our business; $35 million ($28 million net of taxes) of charges associated with the acquisition of GreatCall, including acquisition-related transaction costs and the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets; and $7 million ($5 million net of taxes) related to a one-time bonus for certain employees in response to future tax savings created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""tax reform"" or ""Tax Act"") enacted into law in fiscal 2018.

Furthermore, we believe that our non-GAAP debt to EBITDAR ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. We also believe our non-GAAP debt to EBITDAR ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to|26|\n---\n|Content|Page Number|\n|---|---|\n|Table of Contents| |\n|Business Strategy| |\n|Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue| |\n\nthat of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders.\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we executed against the three priorities we shared at the beginning of the year:\n\n- Build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business;\n- Drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and\n- Advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.\n\nBelow is summary of our progress against these priorities:\n\n- We believe we continued to gain market share in most of our product categories. We believe the total market for our product categories was down low-single digits in calendar 2016 and that our market share gains helped us offset the market decline;\n- We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 350 basis points;\n- We grew the Domestic segment online revenue with comparable sales of 20.8% in fiscal 2017;\n- The successful Canadian brand consolidation was the primary driver of operating income of $90 million in our International segment for fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of $210 million in fiscal 2016;\n- We continued to progress against our three-year target to reduce cost and optimize gross profit by $400 million and achieved $350 million cumulative savings by the end of fiscal 2017; these savings enable us to invest in customer experience improvements while maintaining near flat SG&A;\n- As for the third priority, fiscal 2017 was a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are continuing to test several concepts around the country that we believe have the potential to be compelling customer experiences; we expect to launch some of these concepts in fiscal 2018.\n\nBest Buy 2020: Building the New Blue\n\nIn November 2012, we introduced our transformation strategy called Renew Blue. Since then we have stabilized comparable sales and increased our profitability. A little more than four years later, we have now completed Renew Blue and unveiled a new strategy: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.\n\nOur customers are at the core of Best Buy 2020. Technology continues to evolve, creating more excitement and opening up an increasing range of possibilities for our customers. It is also creating more complexity and we believe many of our customers need our help. Our purpose is to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives with the help of technology. We want to play two roles for them: be their trusted adviser and solution provider; and be their source for technology services for their home. Our customer value proposition is to be the leading technology expert who makes it easy for our customers to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, we seek to gradually grow our revenue, pursue ongoing cost savings necessary to both offset inflationary pressures and fund investments and build a more predictable set of revenue streams built on more recurring revenues and stickier customer relationships. There are three growth pillars we will be pursuing as part of Best Buy 2020:\n\n- Maximize the multi-channel retail business by continuing to enhance the customer experience, investing in growth of certain key product categories and developing broader and stickier customer relationships;\n- Provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships - for example, by meeting the significant technical support needs of our customers and providing more complete solutions such as security monitoring and home automation services as well as the associated products;\n- Accelerate growth in our International segment, which consists of Canada and Mexico.', 'We continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy. As we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. In fiscal 2024, we currently expect to close approximately 20 to 30 Best Buy stores and to increase the number of Outlet Centers to approximately 30.\n\n## Domestic Segment Revenue Mix and Comparable Sales\n\n| |Revenue Mix Summary| |Comparable Sales Summary|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| | | |2023|2022|2023|2022|\n|Computing and Mobile Phones|43%|44%|(12.0)%|5.1%|\n|Consumer Electronics|30%|31%|(12.2)%|15.9%|\n|Appliances|15%|14%|(5.7)%|24.1%|\n|Entertainment|6%|6%|(5.5)%|7.4%|\n|Services|5%|5%|(2.5)%|5.9%|\n|Other|1%|-%|1.6%|N/A|\n|Total|100%|100%|(10.3)%|11.0%|\n\nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\n\n- Computing and Mobile Phones: The 12.0% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones, wearables and tablets.\n- Consumer Electronics: The 12.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, digital imaging and headphones.\n- Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.\n- Entertainment: The 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software.\n- Services: The 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering that includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.\n\nOur gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and higher supply chain costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.\n\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.\n\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nOur operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above and decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate.\n---\n## International Segment\n\n| |2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Revenue|$ 3,504|$ 3,931|$ 3,969|\n|Revenue % change|(10.9)%|(1.0)%|12.6 %|\n|Comparable sales % change|(5.4)%|3.3 %|15.0 %|\n|Gross profit|$ 806|$ 938|$ 853|\n|Gross profit as a % of revenue|23.0 %|23.9 %|21.5 %|\n|SG&A|$ 638|$ 689|$ 689|\n|SG&A as a % of revenue|18.2 %|17.5 %|17.4 %|\n|Restructuring charges|$ 7|$ 5|$ 121|\n|Operating income|$ 161|$ 244|$ 43|\n|Operating income as a % of revenue|4.6 %|6.2 %|1.1 %|\n\nThe decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower sales in Canada due to comparable sales declines across most of our product categories and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.']"
